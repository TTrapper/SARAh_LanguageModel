Frankenstein, ][  ][ or the Modern Prometheus ][  ][ by ][  ][ Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley ][  ][ Letter 1 ][  ][ St. P
 ][ etersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17-- ][  ][ TO Mrs. Saville, England ][  ][ You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied
 the ][  ][  ][ commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil ][  ][ forebodings.  I arrived here yesterd
ay, and  ][ my first task is to assure ][  ][ my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success ][  ][ of my
 undertaking ][ . ][  ][ I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of ][  ][ Petersburgh, I feel a cold nor
thern breeze pla ][ y upon my cheeks, which ][  ][ braces my nerves and fills me with delight.  Do you understand this ][  ][ fe
eling?  This breeze, ][  which has travelled from the regions towards ][  ][ which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those
 icy climes. ][  ][ Insp ][ irited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent ][  ][ and vivid.  I try in vain to
 be persuaded that the pole  ][ is the seat of ][  ][ frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the ][ 
 ][ region of beauty and delight ][ .  There, Margaret, the sun is forever ][  ][ visible, its broad disk just skirting the hori
zon and diffusing a ][  ][ perpetual ][  splendour.  There--for with your leave, my sister, I will put ][  ][ some trust in prec
eding navigators--there snow and frost a ][ re banished; ][  ][ and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpass
ing in ][  ][ wonders and in beauty every re ][ gion hitherto discovered on the habitable ][  ][ globe.  Its productions and fea
tures may be without example, as the ][  ][ phen ][ omena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered ][  ][ so
litudes.  What may not be expected in a country of e ][ ternal light?  I ][  ][ may there discover the wondrous power which attr
acts the needle and may ][  ][ regulate a thousand celes ][ tial observations that require only this ][  ][ voyage to render the
ir seeming eccentricities consistent forever.  I ][  ][ shal ][ l satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the wo
rld ][  ][ never before visited, and may tread a land never befo ][ re imprinted by ][  ][ the foot of man. These are my enticem
ents, and they are sufficient to ][  ][ conquer all fear of danger o ][ r death and to induce me to commence this ][  ][ laborio
us voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little ][  ][  ][ boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of di
scovery up his ][  ][ native river. But supposing all these conjectures to b ][ e false, you ][  ][ cannot contest the inestimab
le benefit which I shall confer on all ][  ][ mankind, to the last generation, b ][ y discovering a passage near the pole ][  ][
 to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are ][  ][ requisite;  ][ or by ascertaining the secret of the mag
net, which, if at ][  ][ all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mi ][ ne. ][  ][ These reflections have di
spelled the agitation with which I began my ][  ][ letter, and I feel my heart glow with an  ][ enthusiasm which elevates me ][ 
 ][ to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as ][  ][ a steady purpo ][ se--a point on which the sou
l may fix its intellectual ][  ][ eye.  This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early yea ][ rs. I ][  ][ have read w
ith ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have ][  ][ been made in the prospect of arriving a ][ t the North Pacific 
Ocean ][  ][ through the seas which surround the pole.  You may remember that a ][  ][ history of all the vo ][ yages made for p
urposes of discovery composed the ][  ][ whole of our good Uncle Thomas' library.  My education was neglected, ] ][ [  ][ yet I 
was passionately fond of reading.  These volumes were my study ][  ][ day and night, and my familiarity with them in ][ creased 
that regret which ][  ][ I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father's dying injunction ][  ][ had forbidden my u ][ ncle
 to allow me to embark in a seafaring life. ][  ][ These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets ][  ] ][ 
[ whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.  I also ][  ][ became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise o
 ][ f my own creation; ][  ][ I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the ][  ][ names of Homer and Shak
espe ][ are are consecrated.  You are well ][  ][ acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment. ][  ][ B
ut just  ][ at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my ][  ][ thoughts were turned into the channel of their earl
ier bent. ][ ][   ][ Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.  I ][  ][ can, even now, remember the hou
r from which I d ][ edicated myself to this ][  ][ great enterprise.  I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.  I ][  ][ acco
mpanied the whale-fi ][ shers on several expeditions to the North Sea; ][  ][ I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and wa
nt of sleep; I often ][  ][  ][ worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my ][  ][ nights to the study o
f mathematics, the theory of ][  medicine, and those ][  ][ branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might der
ive ][  ][ the greatest practica ][ l advantage.  Twice I actually hired myself as an ][  ][ under-mate in a Greenland whaler, a
nd acquitted myself to admiration. I ][  ][  ][ must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second ][  ][ dign
ity in the vessel and entreated me to re ][ main with the greatest ][  ][ earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services. 
 And now, dear ][  ][ Margaret, do I not des ][ erve to accomplish some great purpose?  My life ][  ][ might have been passed in
 ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to ][  ] ][ [ every enticement that wealth placed in my path.  Oh, that some ][  ][ enco
uraging voice would answer in the affirmative!  My c ][ ourage and my ][  ][ resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my 
spirits are often ][  ][ depressed.  I am about to proce ][ ed on a long and difficult voyage, the ][  ][ emergencies of which w
ill demand all my fortitude:  I am required not ][  ][ only  ][ to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own,
 ][  ][ when theirs are failing. ][  ][ This is the most favoura ][ ble period for travelling in Russia.  They fly ][  ][ quickl
y over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in ][ ][   ][ my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an Engl
ish stagecoach.  The ][  ][ cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in ][  furs--a dress which I have ][  ][ already adopted, 
for there is a great difference between walking the ][  ][ deck and remainin ][ g seated motionless for hours, when no exercise 
][  ][ prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.  I have no ][  ] ][ [ ambition to lose my life on the post-road 
between St. Petersburgh and ][  ][ Archangel. I shall depart for the latter town in  ][ a fortnight or three ][  ][ weeks; and m
y intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be ][  ][ done by paying the insur ][ ance for the owner, and to engage as
 many ][  ][ sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the ][  ][ whale ][ -fishing.  I do not intend to sa
il until the month of June; and ][  ][ when shall I return?  Ah, dear sister, how can I answer t ][ his question? ][  ][ If I su
cceed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you ][  ][ and I may meet.  If I fail, you ][  will see me again soon,
 or never. ][  ][ Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on ][  ][ you, and ][  save me, that I may
 again and again testify my gratitude for ][  ][ all your love and kindness. ][  ][ Your affectionate brothe ][ r, ][  ][   R. W
alton ][  ][ Letter 2 ][  ][ Archangel, 28th March, 17-- ][  ][ To Mrs. Saville, England ][  ][ How slowly the t ][ ime passes h
ere, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! ][  ][ Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.  I have hired a ][  ][  ][ 
vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have ][  ][ already engaged appear to be men on whom I can ][  dep
end and are certainly ][  ][ possessed of dauntless courage. ][  ][ But I have one want which I have never yet been able to  ][ 
satisfy, and ][  ][ the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I ][  ][ have no friend, Margaret:  whe
 ][ n I am glowing with the enthusiasm of ][  ][ success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by ][  ][ d
isap ][ pointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I ][  ][ shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but
 that is ][  a poor ][  ][ medium for the communication of feeling.  I desire the company of a man ][  ][ who could sympathize w
ith me, whos ][ e eyes would reply to mine. You may ][  ][ deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a ]
[  ][ friend.  I ][  have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a ][  ][ cultivated as well as of a capacious mind
, whose tastes are l ][ ike my ][  ][ own, to approve or amend my plans.  How would such a friend repair the ][  ][ faults of yo
ur poor brother!  I am t ][ oo ardent in execution and too ][  ][ impatient of difficulties.  But it is a still greater evil to 
me that I ][  ][ am self-edu ][ cated:  for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild ][  ][ on a common and read nothing b
ut our Uncle Thomas' books of vo ][ yages. At ][  ][ that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own ][  ][ co
untry; but it was only when it had c ][ eased to be in my power to derive ][  ][ its most important benefits from such a convict
ion that I perceived the ][  ][ necessit ][ y of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my ][  ][ native country. 
 Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality mor ][ e ][  ][ illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.  It is true that I have ][ 
 ][ thought more and that my daydreams are more  ][ extended and magnificent, ][  ][ but they want (as the painters call it) KEE
PING; and I greatly need a ][  ][ friend who would h ][ ave sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and ][  ][ affection eno
ugh for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.  Well, thes ][ e ][  ][ are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on
 the wide ][  ][ ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among me ][ rchants and seamen.  Yet ][  ][ some feelings, unallied to the d
ross of human nature, beat even in ][  ][ these rugged bosoms.   ][ My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of ][  ][ wonderful co
urage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or ][  ][ rathe ][ r, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advance
ment in ][  ][ his profession.  He is an Englishman, and in the midst of ][  national and ][  ][ professional prejudices, unsoft
ened by cultivation, retains some of the ][  ][ noblest endowments of humani ][ ty.  I first became acquainted with him on ][  ]
[ board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I ][  ][ ea ][ sily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.
  The master is a person ][  ][ of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ][  ship for his ][  ][ gentleness and the 
mildness of his discipline.  This circumstance, ][  ][ added to his well-known integrity ][  and dauntless courage, made me very
 ][  ][ desirous to engage him.  A youth passed in solitude, my best years ][  ][ spent unde ][ r your gentle and feminine foste
rage, has so refined the ][  ][ groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense dis ][ taste ][  ][ to the usual br
utality exercised on board ship:  I have never believed ][  ][ it to be necessary, and when I heard  ][ of a mariner equally not
ed for his ][  ][ kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his ][  ][ crew, I fe ][ lt myself peculiarly
 fortunate in being able to secure his ][  ][ services.  I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, f ][ rom a ][  ][ lad
y who owes to him the happiness of her life.  This, briefly, is his ][  ][ story.  Some years ago he loved a you ][ ng Russian l
ady of moderate ][  ][ fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the ][  ][ father of the girl  ][ consente
d to the match.  He saw his mistress once ][  ][ before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing ][  ][ 
 ][ herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same ][  ][ time that she loved another, but that he  ][ 
was poor, and that her father ][  ][ would never consent to the union.  My generous friend reassured the ][  ][ suppliant, and o
 ][ n being informed of the name of her lover, instantly ][  ][ abandoned his pursuit.  He had already bought a farm with his mo
ney, ][  on ][  ][ which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he ][  ][ bestowed the whole on his rival, toget
her with ][  the remains of his ][  ][ prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young ][  ][ woman's father
 to consent  ][ to her marriage with her lover.  But the old ][  ][ man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to m
y friend, ][  ][ ][  who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor ][  ][ returned until he heard that his 
former mistress was  ][ married according ][  ][ to her inclinations.  "What a noble fellow!" you will exclaim.  He is ][  ][ so
; but then he is wholly  ][ uneducated:  he is as silent as a Turk, and a ][  ][ kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, whic
h, while it renders his ][   ][ ][ conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy ][  ][ which otherwise 
he would command. ][  ][ Yet do  ][ not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can ][  ][ conceive a consolation for 
my toils which I may never know, tha ][ t I am ][  ][ wavering in my resolutions.  Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage ][ 
 ][ is only now delayed until the weathe ][ r shall permit my embarkation.  The ][  ][ winter has been dreadfully severe, but th
e spring promises well, and it ][  ][ is con ][ sidered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail ][  ][ sooner t
han I expected.  I shall do nothing rashly:  you ][  know me ][  ][ sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness w
henever the ][  ][ safety of others is committed to  ][ my care. ][  ][ I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prosp
ect of my ][  ][ undertaking.  It is impossible to commu ][ nicate to you a conception of ][  ][ the trembling sensation, half p
leasurable and half fearful, with which ][  ][ I am preparin ][ g to depart.  I am going to unexplored regions, to "the ][  ][ l
and of mist and snow," but I shall kill no albatross; therefore  ][ do not ][  ][ be alarmed for my safety or if I should come b
ack to you as worn and ][  ][ woeful as the "Ancient Mariner."  You  ][ will smile at my allusion, but I ][  ][ will disclose a 
secret.  I have often attributed my attachment to, my ][  ][ passionate  ][ enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to 
that ][  ][ production of the most imaginative of modern poets.  There is so ][ mething ][  ][ at work in my soul which I do not
 understand.  I am practically ][  ][ industrious--painstaking, a workman to exe ][ cute with perseverance and ][  ][ labour--bu
t besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief ][  ][ in the marvellous ][ , intertwined in all my projects, which 
hurries me out ][  ][ of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited  ][ ][  ][ regions I am about to explore
. But to return to dearer considerations. ][  ][ Shall I meet you again, after having traver ][ sed immense seas, and ][  ][ ret
urned by the most southern cape of Africa or America?  I dare not ][  ][ expect such success, ye ][ t I cannot bear to look on t
he reverse of the ][  ][ picture.  Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: ][  ][  ][ I may receive your l
etters on some occasions when I need them most to ][  ][ support my spirits.  I love you very tenderly.  ][  Remember me with ][
  ][ affection, should you never hear from me again. ][  ][ Your affectionate brother, ][  ][   Robert Walto ][ n ][  ][ Letter 
3 ][  ][ July 7th, 17-- ][  ][ To Mrs. Saville, England ][  ][ My dear Sister, ][  ][ I write a few lines in has ][ te to say th
at I am safe--and well advanced ][  ][ on my voyage.  This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on ][  ][  ][ its home
ward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not ][  ][ see my native land, perhaps, for many years.  I am ][ , ho
wever, in good ][  ][ spirits:  my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the ][  ][ floating sheets of ice tha ][ 
t continually pass us, indicating the dangers ][  ][ of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We ][ 
 ][  ][ have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of ][  ][ summer, and although not so warm as in England
, th ][ e southern gales, ][  ][ which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire ][  ][ to attain, breath
e a degr ][ ee of renovating warmth which I had not ][  ][ expected. ][  ][ No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would ma
ke a figure  ][ in a ][  ][ letter.  One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are ][  ][ accidents which experienced n
avigators scarce ][ ly remember to record, and ][  ][ I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage. ]
[  ][ Adieu, my dear ][  Margaret.  Be assured that for my own sake, as well as ][  ][ yours, I will not rashly encounter danger
.  I will be cool, ][  ] ][ [ persevering, and prudent. ][  ][ But success SHALL crown my endeavours.  Wherefore not?  Thus far 
I have ][  ][ gone, tracing  ][ a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars ][  ][ themselves being witnesses and testim
onies of my triumph.  Why not ][ ][   ][ still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?  What can stop the ][  ][ determin
ed heart and resolved will of man? ] ][ [  ][ My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.  But I must ][  ][ finish. 
 Heaven bless my beloved sister! ][  ][  ][ R.W. ][  ][ Letter 4 ][  ][ August 5th, 17-- ][  ][ To Mrs. Saville, England ][  ][ 
So strange an accident has happened to us th ][ at I cannot forbear ][  ][ recording it, although it is very probable that you w
ill see me before ][  ][ these papers can come i ][ nto your possession. ][  ][ Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounde
d by ice, which closed ][  ][ in the ship on all sid ][ es, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which ][  ][ she floated.  Our 
situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we ][  ] ][ [ were compassed round by a very thick fog.  We accordingly lay to, 
][  ][ hoping that some change would take place in the atmos ][ phere and weather. ][  ][ About two o'clock the mist cleared awa
y, and we beheld, stretched out ][  ][ in every direction, vast  ][ and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to ][  ][ have no 
end.  Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to ][  ][ g ][ row watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight
 suddenly ][  ][ attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude fro ][ m our own ][  ][ situation.  We perceived a low carr
iage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by ][  ][ dogs, pass on towards the north, ][  at the distance of half a mile; a ][  ][ being 
which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, ][  ][ sat in  ][ the sledge and guided the dogs.  We watched 
the rapid progress ][  ][ of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost amo ][ ng the ][  ][ distant inequalities of th
e ice.  This appearance excited our ][  ][ unqualified wonder.  We were, as we believed, ][  many hundred miles from ][  ][ any 
land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in ][  ][ reality, so distant as ][  we had supposed.  Shut in, howe
ver, by ice, it ][  ][ was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the ][  ][ ][  greatest attention.  About 
two hours after this occurrence we heard the ][  ][ ground sea, and before night the ice broke and f ][ reed our ship.  We, ][  
][ however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark ][  ][ those large loose masses w ][ hich float about aft
er the breaking up of the ][  ][ ice.  I profited of this time to rest for a few hours. ][  ][ In the mornin ][ g, however, as s
oon as it was light, I went upon deck and ][  ][ found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparentl ][ y ][  ][ tal
king to someone in the sea.  It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we ][  ][ had seen before, which had drifted towar ][ ds us in
 the night on a large ][  ][ fragment of ice.  Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human ][  ][ being within it ][  who
m the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. ][  ][ He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabita ][ 
nt of ][  ][ some undiscovered island, but a European.  When I appeared on deck the ][  ][ master said, "Here is our captain, an
 ][ d he will not allow you to perish ][  ][ on the open sea." ][  ][ On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, al
thou ][ gh with a ][  ][ foreign accent.  "Before I come on board your vessel," said he, "will ][  ][ you have the kindness to i
nform me ][  whither you are bound?" ][  ][ You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed ][  ][ to me f
rom a man on ][  the brink of destruction and to whom I should have ][  ][ supposed that my vessel would have been a resource wh
ich he would not ][  ][  ][ have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.  I ][  ][ replied, however, that w
e were on a voyage o ][ f discovery towards the ][  ][ northern pole. ][  ][ Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consent
ed to come on board. ][  ][  ][ Good God!  Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for ][  ][ his safety, your su
rprise would have been bound ][ less.  His limbs were ][  ][ nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and ][ 
 ][ suffering.  I never saw a ma ][ n in so wretched a condition.  We attempted ][  ][ to carry him into the cabin, but as soon 
as he had quitted the fresh ][  ][ a ][ ir he fainted.  We accordingly brought him back to the deck and ][  ][ restored him to a
nimation by rubbing him with brandy and  ][ forcing him to ][  ][ swallow a small quantity.  As soon as he showed signs of life 
we ][  ][ wrapped him up in blankets and pla ][ ced him near the chimney of the ][  ][ kitchen stove.  By slow degrees he recove
red and ate a little soup, ][  ][ which restored ][  him wonderfully. ][  ][ Two days passed in this manner before he was able t
o speak, and I often ][  ][ feared that his sufferin ][ gs had deprived him of understanding.  When he ][  ][ had in some measur
e recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and ][  ][ at ][ tended on him as much as my duty would permit.  I never saw a more ]
[  ][ interesting creature:  his eyes have generally an expr ][ ession of ][  ][ wildness, and even madness, but there are momen
ts when, if anyone ][  ][ performs an act of kindness towards hi ][ m or does him any the most ][  ][ trifling service, his whol
e countenance is lighted up, as it were, with ][  ][ a beam of benev ][ olence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.  But he 
][  ][ is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes  ][ his ][  ][ teeth, as if impatient of the weight of w
oes that oppresses him. ][  ][ When my guest was a little recovered I had gr ][ eat trouble to keep off ][  ][ the men, who wish
ed to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not ][  ][ allow him to be torme ][ nted by their idle curiosity, in a state of 
body ][  ][ and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. ][  ][ ][  Once, however, the lieutenant asked why
 he had come so far upon the ice ][  ][ in so strange a vehicle. ][  ][ His countenance  ][ instantly assumed an aspect of the d
eepest gloom, and ][  ][ he replied, "To seek one who fled from me." ][  ][ "And did the man ][  whom you pursued travel in the 
same fashion?" ][  ][ "Yes." ][  ][ "Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked ][  you up we ][  ][ saw some d
ogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice." ][  ][ This aroused the stranger's attentio ][ n, and he asked a multit
ude of ][  ][ questions concerning the route which the demon, as he called him, had ][  ][ pursued.  Soo ][ n after, when he was
 alone with me, he said, "I have, ][  ][ doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good ][ ][   ][ people; but
 you are too considerate to make inquiries." ][  ][ "Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman  ][ in me to ][ 
 ][ trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine." ][  ][ "And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situat ][ ion; you
 have ][  ][ benevolently restored me to life." ][  ][ Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of  ][ the 
][  ][ ice had destroyed the other sledge.  I replied that I could not answer ][  ][ with any degree of certainty, for the i ][ 
ce had not broken until near ][  ][ midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety ][  ][ before that time;
 ][  but of this I could not judge.  From this time a new ][  ][ spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.  He
 ][  ][  ][ manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the ][  ][ sledge which had before appeared; but I ha
ve persu ][ aded him to remain in ][  ][ the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the ][  ][ atmosphere.  I h
ave promised ][  that someone should watch for him and give ][  ][ him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight. 
][  ][ Such is m ][ y journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the ][  ][ present day.  The stranger has gradual
ly improved in healt ][ h but is very ][  ][ silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. ][  ][ Yet hi
s manners are so concili ][ ating and gentle that the sailors are all ][  ][ interested in him, although they have had very litt
le communication ][  ][ with ][  him.  For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his ][  ][ constant and deep grief
 fills me with sympathy and comp ][ assion.  He must ][  ][ have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wre
ck ][  ][ so attractive and amiable. ][   I said in one of my letters, my dear ][  ][ Margaret, that I should find no friend on 
the wide ocean; yet I have ][  ][ found  ][ a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should ][  ][ have been ha
ppy to have possessed as the brother of my h ][ eart. ][  ][ I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, ]
[  ][ should I have any fresh incidents to recor ][ d. ][  ][ August 13th, 17-- ][  ][ My affection for my guest increases every
 day.  He excites at once my ][  ][ admiration and m ][ y pity to an astonishing degree.  How can I see so ][  ][ noble a creatu
re destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant ][  ][  ][ grief?  He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultiva
ted, and ][  ][ when he speaks, although his words are culle ][ d with the choicest art, ][  ][ yet they flow with rapidity and 
unparalleled eloquence.  He is now much ][  ][ recovered from hi ][ s illness and is continually on the deck, apparently ][  ][ 
watching for the sledge that preceded his own.  Yet, although unhapp ][ y, ][  ][ he is not so utterly occupied by his own miser
y but that he interests ][  ][ himself deeply in the projects of others. ][   He has frequently conversed ][  ][ with me on mine
, which I have communicated to him without disguise.  He ][  ][ entered atte ][ ntively into all my arguments in favour of my ev
entual ][  ][ success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken t ][ o ][  ][ secure it.  I was easily led by the
 sympathy which he evinced to use ][  ][ the language of my heart, to give utterance ][  to the burning ardour of my ][  ][ soul
 and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I ][  ][ would sacrifice my ][  fortune, my existence, my every hop
e, to the ][  ][ furtherance of my enterprise.  One man's life or death were but a small ][  ][  ][ price to pay for the acquire
ment of the knowledge which I sought, for ][  ][ the dominion I should acquire and transmit over ][  the elemental foes of ][  ]
[ our race.  As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's ][  ][ countenance.  At first I perc ][ eived that he tried to s
uppress his ][  ][ emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and ][  ][ failed ][  me as I beheld tear
s trickle fast from between his fingers; a ][  ][ groan burst from his heaving breast.  I paused; at length  ][ he spoke, in ][ 
 ][ broken accents:  "Unhappy man!  Do you share my madness?  Have you ][  ][ drunk also of the intoxicating dra ][ ught?  Hear 
me; let me reveal my ][  ][ tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!" ][  ][ Such words, you may imagine, str ][ ongly ex
cited my curiosity; but the ][  ][ paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened ][  ][ powers, a ][ nd m
any hours of repose and tranquil conversation were ][  ][ necessary to restore his composure.  Having conquered the violence ][ 
 of ][  ][ his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of ][  ][ passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of 
 ][ despair, he led me again to ][  ][ converse concerning myself personally.  He asked me the history of my ][  ][ earlier year
s.   ][ The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various ][  ][ trains of reflection.  I spoke of my desire of finding a frien
d, of my ][  ][  ][ thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever ][  ][ fallen to my lot, and expressed 
my convictio ][ n that a man could boast of ][  ][ little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.  "I agree with you," ][  ][
 replied the str ][ anger; "we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, ][  ][ if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves--
such a friend ought  ][ to ][  ][ be--do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I ][  ][ once had a frie
nd, the most noble of hu ][ man creatures, and am entitled, ][  ][ therefore, to judge respecting friendship.  You have hope, an
d the ][  ][ world before yo ][ u, and have no cause for despair.  But I--I have lost ][  ][ everything and cannot begin life an
ew." ][  ][ As he said this his  ][ countenance became expressive of a calm, settled ][  ][ grief that touched me to the heart. 
 But he was silent and presently ][  ][  ][ retired to his cabin. ][  ][ Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more de
eply than he ][  ][ does the beauties of ][  nature.  The starry sky, the sea, and every sight ][  ][ afforded by these wonderfu
l regions seem still to have the power of ][ ][   ][ elevating his soul from earth.  Such a man has a double existence:  he ][  
][ may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disap ][ pointments, yet when he ][  ][ has retired into himself, he will be like a c
elestial spirit that has a ][  ][ halo around him, w ][ ithin whose circle no grief or folly ventures. ][  ][ Will you smile at 
the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine ][  ][ w ][ anderer?  You would not if you saw him.  You have been tutored and ]
[  ][ refined by books and retirement from the world, and yo ][ u are therefore ][  ][ somewhat fastidious; but this only render
s you the more fit to ][  ][ appreciate the extraordinary merits ][  of this wonderful man.  Sometimes I ][  ][ have endeavoured
 to discover what quality it is which he possesses that ][  ][ eleva ][ tes him so immeasurably above any other person I ever kn
ew.  I ][  ][ believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but nev ][ er-failing ][  ][ power of judgment, a penetration i
nto the causes of things, unequalled ][  ][ for clearness and precision; add ][  to this a facility of expression and a ][  ][ v
oice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music. ][  ][ August 19, 17-- ][ ][   ][ Yesterday the stranger said to me, "You
 may easily perceive, Captain ][  ][ Walton, that I have suffered great and unparall ][ eled misfortunes.  I had ][  ][ determin
ed at one time that the memory of these evils should die with ][  ][ me, but you have wo ][ n me to alter my determination.  You
 seek for ][  ][ knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the ][  ][ gr ][ atification of your wishes may n
ot be a serpent to sting you, as mine ][  ][ has been.  I do not know that the relation of my di ][ sasters will be ][  ][ usefu
l to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same ][  ][ course, exposing yourself to the ][  same dangers which have
 rendered me ][  ][ what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one ][  ][ that  ][ may direct you if yo
u succeed in your undertaking and console you ][  ][ in case of failure.  Prepare to hear of occurrences whi ][ ch are usually ]
[  ][ deemed marvellous.  Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might ][  ][ fear to encounter your unbelie ][ f, perhaps y
our ridicule; but many things ][  ][ will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would ][  ][ pr ][ ovoke th
e laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers ][  ][ of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys  ][ in i
ts series ][  ][ internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed." ][  ][ You may easily imagine that I ][ 
 was much gratified by the offered ][  ][ communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by ][  ][ a recit
 ][ al of his misfortunes.  I felt the greatest eagerness to hear ][  ][ the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partl
y fr ][ om a strong ][  ][ desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.  I expressed ][  ][ these feelings in my answer
. ][  ][ ][  "I thank you," he replied, "for your sympathy, but it is useless; my ][  ][ fate is nearly fulfilled.  I wait but f
or one event ][ , and then I shall ][  ][ repose in peace.  I understand your feeling," continued he, perceiving ][  ][ that I w
ished to interru ][ pt him; "but you are mistaken, my friend, if ][  ][ thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my
 destiny; ][  ][ lis ][ ten to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is ][  ][ determined." ][  ][ He then told m
e that he would commence ][  his narrative the next day when ][  ][ I should be at leisure.  This promise drew from me the warme
st thanks. ][  ][ I have res ][ olved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my ][  ][ duties, to record, as nearly
 as possible in his own words, w ][ hat he has ][  ][ related during the day.  If I should be engaged, I will at least make ][  
][ notes.  This manuscript will doub ][ tless afford you the greatest ][  ][ pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it 
from his own ][  ][ lips--with what inte ][ rest and sympathy shall I read it in some future ][  ][ day!  Even now, as I commenc
e my task, his full-toned voice swells in ][ ][   ][ my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy ][  ][ swe
etness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, ][  while the ][  ][ lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within. 
][  ][ Strange and harrowing must be his story, frig ][ htful the storm which ][  ][ embraced the gallant vessel on its course a
nd wrecked it--thus! ][  ][ Chapter 1 ][  ][ I am by bir ][ th a Genevese, and my family is one of the most ][  ][ distinguished
 of that republic.  My ancestors had been for many years ][  ][  ][ counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several pu
blic ][  ][ situations with honour and reputation.  He was respe ][ cted by all who ][  ][ knew him for his integrity and indefa
tigable attention to public ][  ][ business.  He passed his younger  ][ days perpetually occupied by the ][  ][ affairs of his c
ountry; a variety of circumstances had prevented his ][  ][ marrying ear ][ ly, nor was it until the decline of life that he bec
ame a ][  ][ husband and the father of a family. ][  ][ As the circumstances ][  of his marriage illustrate his character, I can
not ][  ][ refrain from relating them.  One of his most intimate friends was a ] ][ [  ][ merchant who, from a flourishing state
, fell, through numerous ][  ][ mischances, into poverty.  This man, whose name was  ][ Beaufort, was of a ][  ][ proud and unbe
nding disposition and could not bear to live in poverty ][  ][ and oblivion in the same  ][ country where he had formerly been ]
[  ][ distinguished for his rank and magnificence.  Having paid his debts, ][  ][ therefore, ][  in the most honourable manner, 
he retreated with his ][  ][ daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in ][   ][ ][ wretchedness.  My father 
loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and ][  ][ was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfo ][ rtunate circumstances. ]
[  ][ He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct ][  ][ so little worthy of  ][ the affection that u
nited them.  He lost no time in ][  ][ endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begi ][ n ][  ][ the wor
ld again through his credit and assistance. Beaufort had taken ][  ][ effectual measures to conceal himself, and ][  it was ten 
months before my ][  ][ father discovered his abode.  Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened ][  ][ to the house,  ][ which wa
s situated in a mean street near the Reuss.  But ][  ][ when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him.  Beaufor ][ t ha
d ][  ][ saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but ][  ][ it was sufficient to provide him wit ][ 
h sustenance for some months, and ][  ][ in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a ][  ][ merchant's 
 ][ house.  The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; ][  ][ his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had l
eisu ][ re for ][  ][ reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the ][  ][ end of three months he lay o
n a bed  ][ of sickness, incapable of any ][  ][ exertion. ][  ][ His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but sh
e saw ][  ][ ][  with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that ][  ][ there was no other prospect of suppo
rt.  But Carolin ][ e Beaufort ][  ][ possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support ][  ][ her in her a
dversity.  She procu ][ red plain work; she plaited straw and ][  ][ by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely suff
icient to ][  ][ support ][  life. ][  ][ Several months passed in this manner.  Her father grew worse; her time ][  ][ was more
 entirely occupied in attend ][ ing him; her means of subsistence ][  ][ decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in he
r arms, leaving ][  ][ her an or ][ phan and a beggar.  This last blow overcame her, and she knelt ][  ][ by Beaufort's coffin w
eeping bitterly, when my father ente ][ red the ][  ][ chamber.  He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who ][  ][ c
ommitted herself to his care; and after  ][ the interment of his friend he ][  ][ conducted her to Geneva and placed her under t
he protection of a ][  ][ relation.  Two yea ][ rs after this event Caroline became his wife. ][  ][ There was a considerable di
fference between the ages of my parents, but ][  ][  ][ this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted ]
[  ][ affection.  There was a sense of justice in my ][  father's upright mind ][  ][ which rendered it necessary that he should
 approve highly to love ][  ][ strongly.  Perhaps during ][  former years he had suffered from the ][  ][ late-discovered unwort
hiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set ][  ][ a gr ][ eater value on tried worth.  There was a show of gratitude and ]
[  ][ worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly f ][ rom the ][  ][ doting fondness of age, for it was inspired b
y reverence for her ][  ][ virtues and a desire to be the means of,  ][ in some degree, recompensing ][  ][ her for the sorrows 
she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace ][  ][ to his behavi ][ our to her.  Everything was made to yield to her wis
hes ][  ][ and her convenience.  He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic  ][ is ][  ][ sheltered by the gardener, from every 
rougher wind and to surround her ][  ][ with all that could tend to excite pleas ][ urable emotion in her soft and ][  ][ benevo
lent mind.  Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto ][  ][ constant sp ][ irit, had been shaken by what she had go
ne through.  During ][  ][ the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my  ][ father had ][  ][ gradually relinqui
shed all his public functions; and immediately after ][  ][ their union they sought the plea ][ sant climate of Italy, and the c
hange ][  ][ of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, ][  ][ as a ][  restorative for her weakene
d frame. ][  ][ From Italy they visited Germany and France.  I, their eldest child, was ][  ][ born  ][ at Naples, and as an inf
ant accompanied them in their rambles.  I ][  ][ remained for several years their only child.  Much as t ][ hey were ][  ][ atta
ched to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of ][  ][ affection from a very mine of love to ][  bestow them upo
n me.  My mother's ][  ][ tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while ][  ][ regarding me ][  are my firs
t recollections.  I was their plaything and ][  ][ their idol, and something better--their child, the innocent and ] ][ [  ][ he
lpless creature bestowed on them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, ][  ][ and whose future lot it was in their hands  ][ to d
irect to happiness or ][  ][ misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.  With this ][  ][ deep consciousne ][ 
ss of what they owed towards the being to which they ][  ][ had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animat
 ][ ed ][  ][ both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life ][  ][ I received a lesson of patience, of
 cha ][ rity, and of self-control, I was ][  ][ so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment ][  ][ to 
me. For  ][ a long time I was their only care.  My mother had much ][  ][ desired to have a daughter, but I continued their sing
le offspring ][ . ][  ][ When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the ][  ][ frontiers of Italy, they p
assed a week on  ][ the shores of the Lake of ][  ][ Como.  Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages ][  
][ of the poor.  Thi ][ s, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a ][  ][ necessity, a passion--remembering what she had su
ffered, and how she ][   ][ ][ had been relieved--for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the ][  ][ afflicted.  During
 one of their walks a poor c ][ ot in the foldings of a ][  ][ vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, whi
le the ][  ][ number of half-clo ][ thed children gathered about it spoke of penury in ][  ][ its worst shape.  One day, when my
 father had gone by himself to Milan ][ , ][  ][ my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode.  She found a peasant ][  ][ a
nd his wife, hard working, bent down by  ][ care and labour, distributing ][  ][ a scanty meal to five hungry babes.  Among thes
e there was one which ][  ][ attracted my mo ][ ther far above all the rest.  She appeared of a ][  ][ different stock.  The fou
r others were dark-eyed, hardy little ][  ][ vag ][ rants; this child was thin and very fair.  Her hair was the ][  ][ brightest
 living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothin ][ g, seemed ][  ][ to set a crown of distinction on her head.  Her brow wa
s clear and ][  ][ ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and h ][ er lips and the moulding of her ][  ][ face so expressive of sensibi
lity and sweetness that none could behold ][  ][ her without ][  looking on her as of a distinct species, a being ][  ][ heaven-
sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features. The ][  ][  ][ peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of w
onder and ][  ][ admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicate ][ d her history.  She ][  ][ was not her child, but the da
ughter of a Milanese nobleman.  Her mother ][  ][ was a German and had d ][ ied on giving her birth.  The infant had been ][  ][
 placed with these good people to nurse:  they were better off then. ][  ][  ][ They had not been long married, and their eldest
 child was but just ][  ][ born.  The father of their charge was one of those It ][ alians nursed in ][  ][ the memory of the an
tique glory of Italy--one among the schiavi ognor ][  ][ frementi, who exerted himse ][ lf to obtain the liberty of his country.
  He ][  ][ became the victim of its weakness.  Whether he had died or still ][  ][ ling ][ ered in the dungeons of Austria was 
not known.  His property was ][  ][ confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar.  S ][ he continued ][  ][ with her fos
ter parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a ][  ][ garden rose among dark-leaved  ][ brambles.  When my father re
turned from ][  ][ Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer ][  ][ th ][ an pictured cherub--a cr
eature who seemed to shed radiance from her ][  ][ looks and whose form and motions were lighter than th ][ e chamois of the ][ 
 ][ hills.  The apparition was soon explained.  With his permission my ][  ][ mother prevailed on her rustic ][  guardians to yi
eld their charge to her. ][  ][ They were fond of the sweet orphan.  Her presence had seemed a blessing ][  ][ t ][ o them, but 
it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want ][  ][ when Providence afforded her such powerful protecti ][ on.  The
y consulted ][  ][ their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became ][  ][ the inmate of my parent ][ s' h
ouse--my more than sister--the beautiful and ][  ][ adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures. ][  ][ Everyone ][ 
 loved Elizabeth.  The passionate and almost reverential ][  ][ attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it
 ][ , my ][  ][ pride and my delight.  On the evening previous to her being brought to ][  ][ my home, my mother had said playfu
lly, ][  "I have a pretty present for my ][  ][ Victor--tomorrow he shall have it."  And when, on the morrow, she ][  ][ present
ed Eliza ][ beth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish ][  ][ seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upo
n Elizabeth  ][ ][  ][ as mine--mine to protect, love, and cherish.  All praises bestowed on ][  ][ her I received as made to a 
possession of my ][  own.  We called each other ][  ][ familiarly by the name of cousin.  No word, no expression could body ][  
][ forth the kind of ][  relation in which she stood to me--my more than ][  ][ sister, since till death she was to be mine only
. ][  ][ Chapter 2 ][  ] ][ [ We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in ][  ][ our ages.  I need not
 say that we were strangers  ][ to any species of ][  ][ disunion or dispute.  Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and ][
  ][ the diversity and contrast  ][ that subsisted in our characters drew us ][  ][ nearer together.  Elizabeth was of a calmer 
and more concentrated ][  ][ disposi ][ tion; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense ][  ][ application and wa
s more deeply smitten with the thirst fo ][ r knowledge. ][  ][ She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the po
ets; ][  ][ and in the majestic and wondrous ][  scenes which surrounded our Swiss home ][  ][ --the sublime shapes of the mount
ains, the changes of the seasons, ][  ][ tempest ][  and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of ][  ][ our 
Alpine summers--she found ample scope for admiration ][  and delight. ][  ][ While my companion contemplated with a serious and 
satisfied spirit the ][  ][ magnificent appearances of t ][ hings, I delighted in investigating their ][  ][ causes.  The world 
was to me a secret which I desired to divine. ][  ][ Curiosi ][ ty, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, ][  ][ 
gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among ][  the ][  ][ earliest sensations I can remember. ][  ][ On th
e birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave ] ][ [  ][ up entirely their wandering life and fixed themsel
ves in their native ][  ][ country.  We possessed a house in Geneva, and ][  a campagne on Belrive, ][  ][ the eastern shore of 
the lake, at the distance of rather more than a ][  ][ league from the city. ][   We resided principally in the latter, and the 
][  ][ lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.  It was my ][  ][  ][ temper to avoid a crowd and to attach my
self fervently to a few.  I was ][  ][ indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows  ][ in general; but I united ][  ][ myself i
n the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.  Henry ][  ][ Clerval was the s ][ on of a merchant of Geneva.  He was 
a boy of singular ][  ][ talent and fancy.  He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger f ][ or ][  ][ its own sake.  He was 
deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.  He ][  ][ composed heroic songs and began to writ ][ e many a tale of enchantment
 and ][  ][ knightly adventure.  He tried to make us act plays and to enter into ][  ][ masquerades, ][  in which the characters
 were drawn from the heroes of ][  ][ Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrou ][ s ][  ][ train who s
hed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands ][  ][ of the infidels. ][  ][ No human being co ][ uld have passed 
a happier childhood than myself.  My ][  ][ parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence ][ . ][  ][ We 
felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to ][  ][ their caprice, but the agents and creators o ][ f all th
e many delights ][  ][ which we enjoyed.  When I mingled with other families I distinctly ][  ][ discerned how peculiarl ][ y fo
rtunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted ][  ][ the development of filial love. ][  ][ My temper was sometimes violent, an ][ 
d my passions vehement; but by some ][  ][ law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits ][  ][ but to an
 ][  eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things ][  ][ indiscriminately.  I confess that neither the structure of langua
ges, ][  ][  ][ nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states ][  ][ possessed attractions for me.  It was the
 secrets ][  of heaven and earth ][  ][ that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of ][  ][ things or th
e inner spir ][ it of nature and the mysterious soul of man ][  ][ that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the met
aphysical, ][  ] ][ [ or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world. ][  ][ Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so 
to speak, with the m ][ oral ][  ][ relations of things.  The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, ][  ][ and the actions 
of men were his theme; a ][ nd his hope and his dream was ][  ][ to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as 
the ][  ][ gallant and adven ][ turous benefactors of our species.  The saintly soul ][  ][ of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-ded
icated lamp in our peaceful home ][ . ][  ][ Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of ][  ][ her ce
lestial eyes, were ever there to ble ][ ss and animate us.  She was ][  ][ the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I mi
ght have become ][  ][ sullen in my stud ][ y, rought through the ardour of my nature, but that ][  ][ she was there to subdue m
e to a semblance of her own gentleness.  And ][  ][  ][ Clerval--could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?  Yet ]
[  ][ he might not have been so perfectly humane ][ , so thoughtful in his ][  ][ generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness
 amidst his passion for ][  ][ adventurous exploit,  ][ had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of ][  ][ beneficence an
d made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ][  ][  ][ ambition. ][  ][ I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the re
collections of ][  ][ childhood, before misfortune had taint ][ ed my mind and changed its bright ][  ][ visions of extensive us
efulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon ][  ][ self.  B ][ esides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also reco
rd ][  ][ those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after t ][ ale of ][  ][ misery, for when I would account to myself
 for the birth of that ][  ][ passion which afterwards ruled my destiny  ][ I find it arise, like a ][  ][ mountain river, from 
ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, ][  ][ swelling as it proceeded,  ][ it became the torrent which, in its course, ][  
][ has swept away all my hopes and joys.  Natural philosophy is the genius ][  ] ][ [ that has regulated my fate; I desire, ther
efore, in this narration, to ][  ][ state those facts which led to my predilection f ][ or that science.  When ][  ][ I was thir
teen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the ][  ][ baths near Thonon; th ][ e inclemency of the weather obliged 
us to remain a ][  ][ day confined to the inn.  In this house I chanced to find a volume of  ][ ][  ][ the works of Cornelius Ag
rippa.  I opened it with apathy; the theory ][  ][ which he attempts to demonstrate and the wond ][ erful facts which he ][  ][ 
relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.  A new light seemed ][  ][ to dawn upon my mind,  ][ and bounding with joy, I
 communicated my ][  ][ discovery to my father.  My father looked carelessly at the title page ][  ][ of ][  my book and said, "
Ah!  Cornelius Agrippa!  My dear Victor, do not ][  ][ waste your time upon this; it is sad trash." ][  ][ I ][ f, instead of th
is remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to ][  ][ me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirel ][ y exploded a
nd that a ][  ][ modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much ][  ][ greater powers than the an ][ cient, b
ecause the powers of the latter were ][  ][ chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under ][  ][  ][ such
 circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and ][  ][ have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by r ][ 
eturning with ][  ][ greater ardour to my former studies.  It is even possible that the ][  ][ train of my ideas would never hav
 ][ e received the fatal impulse that led ][  ][ to my ruin.  But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by ][  ][ 
no m ][ eans assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I ][  ][ continued to read with the greatest avidity.  Whe
n I retu ][ rned home my ][  ][ first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and ][  ][ afterwards of Paracelsus an
d Albertus M ][ agnus.  I read and studied the ][  ][ wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me ][  ][ tre
asures known to  ][ few besides myself.  I have described myself as ][  ][ always having been imbued with a fervent longing to p
enetrate the ][  ][  ][ secrets of nature.  In spite of the intense labour and wonderful ][  ][ discoveries of modern philosophe
rs, I always came from m ][ y studies ][  ][ discontented and unsatisfied.  Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed ][  ][ that 
he felt like a child picking ][  up shells beside the great and ][  ][ unexplored ocean of truth.  Those of his successors in ea
ch branch of ][  ][ natural phil ][ osophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy's ][  ][ apprehensions as tyros en
gaged in the same pursuit. ][  ][ Th ][ e untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted ][  ][ with their p
ractical uses.  The most learned philoso ][ pher knew little ][  ][ more.  He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her
 immortal ][  ][ lineaments were still a won ][ der and a mystery.  He might dissect, ][  ][ anatomize, and give names; but, not
 to speak of a final cause, causes ][  ][ in the ][ ir secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.  I ][  ][ had 
gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that s ][ eemed to keep ][  ][ human beings from entering the citadel of nature, a
nd rashly and ][  ][ ignorantly I had repined. ][  ][ Bu ][ t here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and ]
[  ][ knew more.  I took their word for all that they averre ][ d, and I became ][  ][ their disciple.  It may appear strange th
at such should arise in the ][  ][ eighteenth century; but while ][  I followed the routine of education in ][  ][ the schools o
f Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with ][  ][ regard t ][ o my favourite studies.  My father was not scientific, a
nd I ][  ][ was left to struggle with a child's blindness, added to a st ][ udent's ][  ][ thirst for knowledge.  Under the guid
ance of my new preceptors I ][  ][ entered with the greatest diligence into  ][ the search of the ][  ][ philosopher's stone and
 the elixir of life; but the latter soon ][  ][ obtained my undivided attention. ][   Wealth was an inferior object, but ][  ][ 
what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from ][  ][ the huma ][ n frame and render man invulnerable to a
ny but a violent death! ][  ][ Nor were these my only visions.  The raising of ghosts or ][  devils was a ][  ][ promise liberal
ly accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of ][  ][ which I most eagerly sought; a ][ nd if my incantations were alway
s ][  ][ unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience ][  ][ and mistake ][  than to a want of skill or 
fidelity in my instructors.  And ][  ][ thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling ][ , like an ][  ][ unadept
, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately ][  ][ in a very slough of multifarious  ][ knowledge, guided by
 an ardent ][  ][ imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the ][  ][ current of m ][ y ideas.  When I
 was about fifteen years old we had retired ][  ][ to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent a ][ nd ][  ][ te
rrible thunderstorm.  It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, ][  ][ and the thunder burst at once with frigh ][ tful lou
dness from various ][  ][ quarters of the heavens.  I remained, while the storm lasted, watching ][  ][ its progress wit ][ h cu
riosity and delight.  As I stood at the door, on a ][  ][ sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful o ][ 
ak ][  ][ which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the ][  ][ dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappea
 ][ red, and nothing remained ][  ][ but a blasted stump.  When we visited it the next morning, we found the ][  ][ tree shatter
ed i ][ n a singular manner.  It was not splintered by the ][  ][ shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.  I never 
beheld ] ][ [  ][ anything so utterly destroyed. ][  ][ Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of ][  ][ 
electricity. ][   On this occasion a man of great research in natural ][  ][ philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastr
ophe, he entered ][  on ][  ][ the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of ][  ][ electricity and galvanis
m, which was at once ][  new and astonishing to me. ][  ][ All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, ][  
][ Albertus Magnus, and  ][ Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by ][  ][ some fatality the overthrow of these men disi
nclined me to pursue my ][   ][ ][ accustomed studies.  It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever ][  ][ be known.  All 
that had so long engaged my atte ][ ntion suddenly grew ][  ][ despicable.  By one of those caprices of the mind which we are pe
rhaps ][  ][ most subject to in earl ][ y youth, I at once gave up my former ][  ][ occupations, set down natural history and al
l its progeny as a deformed ][  ][ and a ][ bortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a ][  ][ would-be science
 which could never even step within the thre ][ shold of ][  ][ real knowledge.  In this mood of mind I betook myself to the ][ 
 ][ mathematics and the branches of study appert ][ aining to that science as ][  ][ being built upon secure foundations, and so
 worthy of my consideration. ][  ][ Thus strangely a ][ re our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments ][  ][ are we bou
nd to prosperity or ruin.  When I look back, it seems to ][  me ][  ][ as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and wi
ll was the ][  ][ immediate suggestion of the guardian angel ][  of my life--the last effort ][  ][ made by the spirit of preser
vation to avert the storm that was even ][  ][ then hanging in t ][ he stars and ready to envelop me.  Her victory was ][  ][ an
nounced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which ][  ][ ][  followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly t
ormenting ][  ][ studies.  It was thus that I was to be taught to associ ][ ate evil with ][  ][ their prosecution, happiness wi
th their disregard. ][  ][ It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but ][  it was ineffectual. ][  ][ Destiny was too pote
nt, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and ][  ][ terrible destruction. ][  ][  ][ Chapter 3 ][  ][ When I had attained
 the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I ][  ][ should become a student at t ][ he university of Ingolstadt.  I had ][  
][ hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it ][  ][ necessary fo ][ r the completion of my education tha
t I should be made ][  ][ acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.  My ][  ][  ][ departure was therefore 
fixed at an early date, but before the day ][  ][ resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortu ][ ne of my life ][  ][ occurre
d--an omen, as it were, of my future misery.  Elizabeth had ][  ][ caught the scarlet fever; her ill ][ ness was severe, and she
 was in the ][  ][ greatest danger.  During her illness many arguments had been urged to ][  ][ persuade ][  my mother to refrai
n from attending upon her.  She had at ][  ][ first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the l ][ ife of ][  ][ he
r favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She ][  ][ attended her sickbed; her watchful  ][ attentions t
riumphed over the ][  ][ malignity of the distemper--Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences ][  ][ of this imprud ][ ence wer
e fatal to her preserver.  On the third day my ][  ][ mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming ][ ][   ][
 symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the ][  ][ worst event.  On her deathbed the fortitude and ][ 
 benignity of this best ][  ][ of women did not desert her.  She joined the hands of Elizabeth and ][  ][ myself.  "My children,
 ][ " she said, "my firmest hopes of future happiness ][  ][ were placed on the prospect of your union.  This expectation will n
ow ] ][ [  ][ be the consolation of your father.  Elizabeth, my love, you must supply ][  ][ my place to my younger children.  A
las!  I  ][ regret that I am taken from ][  ][ you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you ][  ][ all
?  But these ][  are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to ][  ][ resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a 
hope of meeting  ][ ][  ][ you in another world." ][  ][ She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.
 ][  ][ I need not d ][ escribe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent ][  ][ by that most irreparable evil, the void
 that presents itself to ][  the ][  ][ soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.  It is so ][  ][ long before
 the mind can persuade itsel ][ f that she whom we saw every day ][  ][ and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can 
have departed ][  ][ forever--th ][ at the brightness of a beloved eye can have been ][  ][ extinguished and the sound of a voic
e so familiar and dear to the ear ][ ][   ][ can be hushed, never more to be heard.  These are the reflections of ][  ][ the fir
st days; but when the lapse of time prov ][ es the reality of the ][  ][ evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.  Y
et from whom has ][  ][ not that rude hand r ][ ent away some dear connection?  And why should I ][  ][ describe a sorrow which 
all have felt, and must feel?  The time at ][  ] ][ [ length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and ][
  ][ the smile that plays upon the lips, although it ][  may be deemed a ][  ][ sacrilege, is not banished.  My mother was dead,
 but we had still ][  ][ duties which we ought to perfor ][ m; we must continue our course with the ][  ][ rest and learn to thi
nk ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the ][  ][ sp ][ oiler has not seized. ][  ][ My departure for Ingolstadt, which 
had been deferred by these events, ][  ][ was now again determin ][ ed upon.  I obtained from my father a respite of ][  ][ some
 weeks.  It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, ][ ][   ][ akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush
 into the thick of ][  ][ life.  I was new to sorrow, but it did not the ][  less alarm me.  I was ][  ][ unwilling to quit the 
sight of those that remained to me, and above ][  ][ all, I desired to see m ][ y sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled. ][  ]
[ She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all. ][  ][  ][ She looked steadily on life and assumed its 
duties with courage and ][  ][ zeal.  She devoted herself to those whom she had been ][  taught to call ][  ][ her uncle and cou
sins.  Never was she so enchanting as at this time, ][  ][ when she recalled the sunshin ][ e of her smiles and spent them upon 
us. ][  ][ She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget. ][  ][ The da ][ y of my departure at length arri
ved.  Clerval spent the last ][  ][ evening with us.  He had endeavoured to persuade his father  ][ to permit ][  ][ him to acco
mpany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.  His ][  ][ father was a narrow-minded trader ][  and saw idleness and ru
in in the ][  ][ aspirations and ambition of his son.  Henry deeply felt the misfortune ][  ][ of being  ][ debarred from a libe
ral education.  He said little, but when ][  ][ he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glan ][ ce a ][  ][ rest
rained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details ][  ][ of commerce. ][  ][ We sat late.  We c ][ ould not tea
r ourselves away from each other nor ][  ][ persuade ourselves to say the word "Farewell!"  It was said, and we ][   ][ ][ retir
ed under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the ][  ][ other was deceived; but when at morning's dawn I  ][ desc
ended to the ][  ][ carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there--my father ][  ][ again to bless me, Clerval t ][ 
o press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to ][  ][ renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last ][  ][ fe
 ][ minine attentions on her playmate and friend. ][  ][ I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged 
][   ][ ][ in the most melancholy reflections.  I, who had ever been surrounded by ][  ][ amiable companions, continually engage
d in end ][ eavouring to bestow ][  ][ mutual pleasure--I was now alone.  In the university whither I was ][  ][ going I must fo
rm my own fr ][ iends and be my own protector.  My life had ][  ][ hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had 
given me ][  ][  ][ invincible repugnance to new countenances.  I loved my brothers, ][  ][ Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were "
old familiar faces," ][  but I believed ][  ][ myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers.  Such were my ][  ][ reflec
tions as I commenced my  ][ journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits ][  ][ and hopes rose.  I ardently desired the acquisition o
f knowledge.  I ][  ][ had o ][ ften, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth ][  ][ cooped up in one place and 
had longed to enter the world an ][ d take my ][  ][ station among other human beings.  Now my desires were complied with, ][  ]
[ and it would, indeed, have been fo ][ lly to repent. ][  ][ I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections duri
ng my ][  ][ journey to Ingolstadt, whic ][ h was long and fatiguing.  At length the ][  ][ high white steeple of the town met m
y eyes.  I alighted and was ][  ][ conducted ][  to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased. ][  ][ The next mor
ning I delivered my letters of introduction and  ][ paid a ][  ][ visit to some of the principal professors.  Chance--or rather 
the evil ][  ][ influence, the Angel of Destruction, ][  which asserted omnipotent sway ][  ][ over me from the moment I turned 
my reluctant steps from my father's ][  ][ door--led me  ][ first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.  He ][  ][ was 
an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his scie ][ nce. He ][  ][ asked me several questions concerning my progress
 in the different ][  ][ branches of science appertaining to nat ][ ural philosophy.  I replied ][  ][ carelessly, and partly in
 contempt, mentioned the names of my ][  ][ alchemists as the princi ][ pal authors I had studied.  The professor ][  ][ stared.
  "Have you," he said, "really spent your time in studying such ][  ][ n ][ onsense?" ][  ][ I replied in the affirmative.  "Eve
ry minute," continued M. Krempe with ][  ][ warmth, "every instant that you  ][ have wasted on those books is utterly ][  ][ and
 entirely lost.  You have burdened your memory with exploded systems ][  ][ and  ][ useless names.  Good God!  In what desert la
nd have you lived, ][  ][ where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fanc ][ ies which you ][  ][ have so greedily im
bibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they ][  ][ are ancient?  I little expect ][ ed, in this enlightened and scientif
ic ][  ][ age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.  My dear ][  ][ sir, yo ][ u must begin your studies entire
ly anew." ][  ][ So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books ][  ][ treat ][ ing of natural philosophy wh
ich he desired me to procure, and ][  ][ dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the  ][ following ][  ][ week he
 intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural ][  ][ philosophy in its general relations, and  ][ that M. Waldman, a f
ellow ][  ][ professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he ][  ][ omitted. ][  ][ I ret ][ urned home not d
isappointed, for I have said that I had long ][  ][ considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobat ][ ed; but I ][
  ][ returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any ][  ][ shape.  M. Krempe was a little sq ][ uat man 
with a gruff voice and a ][  ][ repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in ][  ][ favour of ][  his
 pursuits.  In rather a too philosophical and connected a ][  ][ strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions ][ 
 I had come ][  ][ to concerning them in my early years.  As a child I had not been ][  ][ content with the results promised by 
 ][ the modern professors of natural ][  ][ science.  With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my ][  ][ extreme yo
uth  ][ and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the ][  ][ steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged
 the ][  ][  ][ discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. ][  ][ Besides, I had a contempt for the
 uses of mod ][ ern natural philosophy. ][  ][ It was very different when the masters of the science sought ][  ][ immortality a
nd power; such v ][ iews, although futile, were grand; but now ][  ][ the scene was changed.  The ambition of the inquirer seeme
d to limit ][  ][ it ][ self to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in ][  ][ science was chiefly founded.  I
 was required to exchang ][ e chimeras of ][  ][ boundless grandeur for realities of little worth. ][  ][ Such were my reflectio
ns during the first two or t ][ hree days of my ][  ][ residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming ][  ][ acqu
ainted with the localities and t ][ he principal residents in my new ][  ][ abode.  But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought
 of the information ][  ][ which M.  ][ Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.  And although I ][  ][ could not consent to
 go and hear that little conceited fello ][ w deliver ][  ][ sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. ][ 
 ][ Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he ha ][ d hitherto been out of town. ][  ][ Partly from curiosity and partly from idlene
ss, I went into the ][  ][ lecturing room, which ][  M. Waldman entered shortly after.  This professor ][  ][ was very unlike hi
s colleague.  He appeared about fifty years of age,  ][ ][  ][ but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few 
grey ][  ][ hairs covered his temples, but those at the  ][ back of his head were ][  ][ nearly black.  His person was short but
 remarkably erect and his voice ][  ][ the sweetest I had ev ][ er heard.  He began his lecture by a ][  ][ recapitulation of th
e history of chemistry and the various improvements ][  ][ made  ][ by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the n
ames ][  ][ of the most distinguished discoverers.  He then took a c ][ ursory view of ][  ][ the present state of the science a
nd explained many of its elementary ][  ][ terms.  After having made a f ][ ew preparatory experiments, he concluded ][  ][ with
 a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall ][  ][ never  ][ forget:  "The ancient teachers of this science,"
 said he, ][  ][ "promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  The modern ma ][ sters ][  ][ promise very little; they know 
that metals cannot be transmuted and ][  ][ that the elixir of life is a chimera but ][  these philosophers, whose ][  ][ hands 
seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the ][  ][ microscope or c ][ rucible, have indeed performed mirac
les.  They penetrate ][  ][ into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her ][  ][ ][  hiding-places.  They ascend int
o the heavens; they have discovered how ][  ][ the blood circulates, and the nature of the air w ][ e breathe.  They have ][  ][
 acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders ][  ][ of heaven, mimic the ][  earthquake, and even mo
ck the invisible world with ][  ][ its own shadows." ][  ][ Such were the professor's words--rather let  ][ me say such the word
s of ][  ][ the fate--enounced to destroy me.  As he went on I felt as if my soul ][  ][ were grappling with ][  a palpable enem
y; one by one the various keys were ][  ][ touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was ][  ][  ][ soun
ded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, ][  ][ one purpose.  So much has been done, excla ][ imed the
 soul of ][  ][ Frankenstein--more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps ][  ][ already marked, I will pionee ][ r a 
new way, explore unknown powers, and ][  ][ unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation. ][  ][ I closed not my ey ][ 
es that night.  My internal being was in a state of ][  ][ insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I
 ][  ][  ][ had no power to produce it.  By degrees, after the morning's dawn, ][  ][ sleep came.  I awoke, and my yesternight's
 tho ][ ughts were as a dream. ][  ][ There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to ][  ][ devote myse
lf to a  ][ science for which I believed myself to possess a ][  ][ natural talent.  On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. 
 His ][  ][  ][ manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, ][  ][ for there was a certain dignity in 
his mien during  ][ his lecture which in ][  ][ his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.  I ][  ][ ga
ve him pretty nearly ][  the same account of my former pursuits as I had ][  ][ given to his fellow professor.  He heard with at
tention the little ][  ] ][ [ narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius ][  ][ Agrippa and Paracelsus
, but without the contempt t ][ hat M. Krempe had ][  ][ exhibited. He said that "These were men to whose indefatigable zeal ][ 
 ][ modern philosophers were ind ][ ebted for most of the foundations of their ][  ][ knowledge.  They had left to us, as an eas
ier task, to give new names ][  ][ a ][ nd arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a ][  ][ great degree ha
d been the instruments of bringing to li ][ ght.  The ][  ][ labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ev
er ][  ][ fail in ultimately turning to the  ][ solid advantage of mankind."  I ][  ][ listened to his statement, which was deli
vered without any presumption ][  ][ or affectat ][ ion, and then added that his lecture had removed my ][  ][ prejudices agains
t modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured ][ ][   ][ terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his ][  ]
[ instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in li ][ fe would have ][  ][ made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which st
imulated my intended ][  ][ labours.  I requested his advice ][  concerning the books I ought to ][  ][ procure. ][  ][ "I am ha
ppy," said M. Waldman, "to have gained a disciple; and if your ] ][ [  ][ application equals your ability, I have no doubt of yo
ur success. ][  ][ Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in ][  which the greatest ][  ][ improvements have been and ma
y be made; it is on that account that I ][  ][ have made it my peculiar  ][ study; but at the same time, I have not ][  ][ negle
cted the other branches of science.  A man would make but a very ][  ][ sorr ][ y chemist if he attended to that department of h
uman knowledge ][  ][ alone.  If your wish is to become really a man of science  ][ and not ][  ][ merely a petty experimentalis
t, I should advise you to apply to every ][  ][ branch of natural philosophy, includ ][ ing mathematics."  He then took me ][  ]
[ into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various ][  ][ machines, instr ][ ucting me as to what I ought to proc
ure and promising me ][  ][ the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the ][  ][  ][ science not to derange t
heir mechanism.  He also gave me the list of ][  ][ books which I had requested, and I took my l ][ eave. ][  ][ Thus ended a da
y memorable to me; it decided my future destiny. ][  ][ Chapter 4 ][  ][ From this day natural philo ][ sophy, and particularly 
chemistry, in the ][  ][ most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. ][  ][  ][ I read with ardour t
hose works, so full of genius and discrimination, ][  ][ which modern inquirers have written on these subjec ][ ts.  I attended 
the ][  ][ lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the ][  ][ university, and I found  ][ even in M. K
rempe a great deal of sound sense ][  ][ and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive ][  ][ physiog ][ nomy and
 manners, but not on that account the less valuable.  In ][  ][ M. Waldman I found a true friend.  His gentleness was ne ][ ver 
tinged by ][  ][ dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and ][  ][ good nature that banished ev ][ 
ery idea of pedantry.  In a thousand ways ][  ][ he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse ][  ][ inqu
 ][ iries clear and facile to my apprehension.  My application was at ][  ][ first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength
 as  ][ I proceeded and ][  ][ soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the ][  ][ light of morning w
hilst I  ][ was yet engaged in my laboratory. ][  ][ As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress ][  ][
 was rapid.  ][  My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and ][  ][ my proficiency that of the masters.  Professo
r Krempe often a ][ sked me, ][  ][ with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman ][  ][ expressed the most
 heartfelt exultatio ][ n in my progress.  Two years ][  ][ passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but w
as ][  ][ engaged, heart ][  and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I ][  ][ hoped to make.  None but those who have
 experienced them can concei ][ ve ][  ][ of the enticements of science.  In other studies you go as far as ][  ][ others have g
one before you, and there is not ][ hing more to know; but in ][  ][ a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery 
and wonder. ][  ][ A mind of moderat ][ e capacity which closely pursues one study must ][  ][ infallibly arrive at great profic
iency in that study; and I, who ][  ][ c ][ ontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was ][  ][ solely wrap
ped up in this, improved so rapidly that at  ][ the end of two ][  ][ years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some c
hemical ][  ][ instruments, which procured me gr ][ eat esteem and admiration at the ][  ][ university.  When I had arrived at t
his point and had become as well ][  ][ acquainted w ][ ith the theory and practice of natural philosophy as ][  ][ depended on 
the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my ] ][ [  ][ residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, 
I thought ][  ][ of returning to my friends and my native to ][ wn, when an incident ][  ][ happened that protracted my stay. ][
  ][ One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my atte ][ ntion was ][  ][ the structure of the human frame, and, inde
ed, any animal endued with ][  ][ life.  Whence, I often asked mysel ][ f, did the principle of life proceed? ][  ][ It was a bo
ld question, and one which has ever been considered as a ][  ][ mystery; ][  yet with how many things are we upon the brink of b
ecoming ][  ][ acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our ][  ][  ][ inquiries.  I revolved these circumstanc
es in my mind and determined ][  ][ thenceforth to apply myself more particularl ][ y to those branches of ][  ][ natural philos
ophy which relate to physiology.  Unless I had been ][  ][ animated by an almost sup ][ ernatural enthusiasm, my application to 
this ][  ][ study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.  To examine the ][  ][ ][  causes of life, we must first have 
recourse to death.  I became ][  ][ acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not ][  sufficient; I ][  ][ must also 
observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. ][  ][ In my education my father had ][  taken the greatest precauti
ons that my ][  ][ mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.  I do not ever ][  ][ reme ][ mber to have trembled at
 a tale of superstition or to have feared ][  ][ the apparition of a spirit.  Darkness had no effect upo ][ n my fancy, and ][  
][ a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of ][  ][ life, which, from being the sea ][ t of beauty and 
strength, had become ][  ][ food for the worm.  Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of ][  ][ this d ][ ecay and for
ced to spend days and nights in vaults and ][  ][ charnel-houses.  My attention was fixed upon every object the most ][  ][  ][ 
insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.  I saw how the ][  ][ fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I b ][ ehel
d the corruption of ][  ][ death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm ][  ][ inherited the wonders of t ][ 
he eye and brain.  I paused, examining and ][  ][ analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change ][  ][ f
 ][ rom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this ][  ][ darkness a sudden light broke in upon me--a light 
so b ][ rilliant and ][  ][ wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity ][  ][ of the prospect which i
t illust ][ rated, I was surprised that among so ][  ][ many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same ][ 
 ][ science, ][  that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a ][  ][ secret. ][  ][ Remember, I am not recording
 the vision of a ][  madman.  The sun does not ][  ][ more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is ][  ][
 true.  Some miracle ][  might have produced it, yet the stages of the ][  ][ discovery were distinct and probable.  After days 
and nights of ][  ][ inc ][ redible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of ][  ][ generation and life; nay,
 more, I became myself capab ][ le of bestowing ][  ][ animation upon lifeless matter. ][  ][ The astonishment which I had at fi
rst experienced on this discover ][ y ][  ][ soon gave place to delight and rapture.  After so much time spent in ][  ][ painful
 labour, to arrive at once at the su ][ mmit of my desires was the ][  ][ most gratifying consummation of my toils.  But this di
scovery was so ][  ][ great and overwhel ][ ming that all the steps by which I had been ][  ][ progressively led to it were obli
terated, and I beheld only the result. ][  ] ][ [ What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation ][  ][
 of the world was now within my grasp.  Not that ][ , like a magic scene, it ][  ][ all opened upon me at once:  the information
 I had obtained was of a ][  ][ nature rather to dir ][ ect my endeavours so soon as I should point them ][  ][ towards the obje
ct of my search than to exhibit that object already ][   ][ ][ accomplished.  I was like the Arabian who had been buried with th
e dead ][  ][ and found a passage to life, aided only by one ][  glimmering and seemingly ][  ][ ineffectual light. ][  ][ I see
 by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes ][  ] ][ [ express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the 
secret with ][  ][ which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen pat ][ iently until the end ][  ][ of my story, and you will ea
sily perceive why I am reserved upon that ][  ][ subject.  I will not le ][ ad you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, ][  ]
[ to your destruction and infallible misery.  Learn from me, if not by my ][ ][   ][ precepts, at least by my example, how dange
rous is the acquirement of ][  ][ knowledge and how much happier that man is who ][  believes his native town ][  ][ to be the w
orld, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature ][  ][ will allow. ][  ] ][ [ When I found so astonishing a power pl
aced within my hands, I hesitated ][  ][ a long time concerning the manner in which I sh ][ ould employ it. ][  ][ Although I po
ssessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to ][  ][ prepare a frame for the reception ][  of it, with all its intricacies
 of ][  ][ fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable ][  ][ difficulty  ][ and labour.  I doubted at fi
rst whether I should attempt the ][  ][ creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organizat ][ ion; but my ][  ][ imagi
nation was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to ][  ][ doubt of my ability to give life  ][ to an animal as comp
lex and wonderful ][  ][ as man.  The materials at present within my command hardly appeared ][  ][ adequate ][  to so arduous a
n undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ][  ][ ultimately succeed.  I prepared myself for a multitude of  ][ reverses; my
 ][  ][ operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be ][  ][ imperfect, yet when I considered the  ][ improvem
ent which every day takes ][  ][ place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present ][  ][ attempts wou ][ ld a
t least lay the foundations of future success.  Nor ][  ][ could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any ] ][ 
[  ][ argument of its impracticability.  It was with these feelings that I ][  ][ began the creation of a human being.  As the m
 ][ inuteness of the parts ][  ][ formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first ][  ][ intention, to ma
ke t ][ he being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, ][  ][ about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.  After havi
ng ][  ] ][ [ formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully ][  ][ collecting and arranging my material
s, I began.  ][ ][  ][ No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like ][  ][ a hurricane, in the first 
enthusiasm of su ][ ccess.  Life and death ][  ][ appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and ][  ][ po
ur a torrent of ligh ][ t into our dark world.  A new species would bless ][  ][ me as its creator and source; many happy and ex
cellent natures would ][ ][   ][ owe their being to me.  No father could claim the gratitude of his ][  ][ child so completely a
s I should deserve theirs.   ][ Pursuing these ][  ][ reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless ][  
][ matter, I might in process of ][  time (although I now found it impossible) ][  ][ renew life where death had apparently devo
ted the body to corruption. ][  ][ T ][ hese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking ][  ][ with unremitti
ng ardour.  My cheek had grown pale with ][  study, and my ][  ][ person had become emaciated with confinement.  Sometimes, on t
he very ][  ][ brink of certainty, I failed; ][  yet still I clung to the hope which the ][  ][ next day or the next hour might 
realize.  One secret which I alone ][  ][ posses ][ sed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon ][  ][ gazed 
on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and br ][ eathless ][  ][ eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.  Who s
hall conceive ][  ][ the horrors of my secret toil as I  ][ dabbled among the unhallowed damps ][  ][ of the grave or tortured t
he living animal to animate the lifeless ][  ][ clay?  My li ][ mbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but ][  
][ then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward ][ ; I seemed ][  ][ to have lost all soul or sensation but for
 this one pursuit.  It was ][  ][ indeed but a passing trance, that  ][ only made me feel with renewed ][  ][ acuteness so soon 
as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had ][  ][ returned to  ][ my old habits.  I collected bones from charnel-house
s and ][  ][ disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the  ][ human ][  ][ frame.  In a solitary chamber, or r
ather cell, at the top of the house, ][  ][ and separated from all the other apa ][ rtments by a gallery and staircase, ][  ][ I
 kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from ][  ][ their so ][ ckets in attending to the details of my 
employment.  The ][  ][ dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my mat ][ erials; ][  ][ and often did my huma
n nature turn with loathing from my occupation, ][  ][ whilst, still urged on by an eagernes ][ s which perpetually increased, I
 ][  ][ brought my work near to a conclusion. ][  ][ The summer months passed while I was thus e ][ ngaged, heart and soul, in ]
[  ][ one pursuit.  It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields ][  ][ bestow a more plenti ][ ful harvest or the vines
 yield a more luxuriant ][  ][ vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.  And the ][ ][   ][ same feelings w
hich made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also ][  ][ to forget those friends who were so many mil ][ es absent, and w
hom I had ][  ][ not seen for so long a time.  I knew my silence disquieted them, and I ][  ][ well remembered t ][ he words of 
my father:  "I know that while you are ][  ][ pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shal ][ l ][  ][
 hear regularly from you.  You must pardon me if I regard any ][  ][ interruption in your correspondence as a proof that ][  you
r other duties ][  ][ are equally neglected." ][  ][ I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings, but I could ] ][ 
[  ][ not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which ][  ][ had taken an irresistible hold of my imagin
 ][ ation.  I wished, as it ][  ][ were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection ][  ][ until the great ob
ject ][ , which swallowed up every habit of my nature, ][  ][ should be completed. ][  ][ I then thought that my father would be
 unjust  ][ if he ascribed my neglect ][  ][ to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was ][  ][ justifi
ed in concei ][ ving that I should not be altogether free from ][  ][ blame.  A human being in perfection ought always to preser
ve a calm and ][ ][   ][ peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to ][  ][ disturb his tranquillity.  I 
do not think that th ][ e pursuit of knowledge ][  ][ is an exception to this rule.  If the study to which you apply yourself ][
  ][ has a tendency to w ][ eaken your affections and to destroy your taste for ][  ][ those simple pleasures in which no alloy 
can possibly mix, then that  ][ ][  ][ study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human ][  ][ mind.  If thi
s rule were always observed; if  ][ no man allowed any pursuit ][  ][ whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domes
tic ][  ][ affections, Greece had no ][ t been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his ][  ][ country, America would have been di
scovered more gradually, and the ][  ][  ][ empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed. ][  ][ But I forget that I am mor
alizing in the most interesting part of my ] ][ [  ][ tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.  My father made no reproach ][ 
 ][ in his letters and only took notice of my si ][ lence by inquiring into my ][  ][ occupations more particularly than before.
  Winter, spring, and summer ][  ][ passed away duri ][ ng my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the ][  ][ expanding l
eaves--sights which before always yielded me supreme ][  ][  ][ delight--so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.  The leaves
 of ][  ][ that year had withered before my work drew near t ][ o a close, and now ][  ][ every day showed me more plainly how w
ell I had succeeded.  But my ][  ][ enthusiasm was checked by my ][  anxiety, and I appeared rather like one ][  ][ doomed by sl
avery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade ][  ][ th ][ an an artist occupied by his favourite employment.  Ever
y night I was ][  ][ oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to  ][ a most painful ][  ][ degree; the fall of a leaf sta
rtled me, and I shunned my fellow ][  ][ creatures as if I had been guilty o ][ f a crime.  Sometimes I grew alarmed ][  ][ at t
he wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose ][  ][ alone su ][ stained me:  my labours would soon end, and 
I believed that ][  ][ exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient diseas ][ e; and I ][  ][ promised myself both of 
these when my creation should be complete. ][  ][ Chapter 5 ][  ][ It was on a dreary ni ][ ght of November that I beheld the ac
complishment ][  ][ of my toils.  With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I ][  ][ co ][ llected the instruments of life 
around me, that I might infuse a ][  ][ spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my fe ][ et.  It was ][  ][ already o
ne in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the ][  ][ panes, and my candle was nearly bur ][ nt out, when, by the gli
mmer of the ][  ][ half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature ][  ][ open; it br ][ eathed hard, and a c
onvulsive motion agitated its limbs. ][  ][ How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delin ][ eate ][  ][ the 
wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to ][  ][ form?  His limbs were in proportion, a ][ nd I had sel
ected his features as ][  ][ beautiful.  Beautiful!  Great God!  His yellow skin scarcely covered ][  ][ the work of ][  muscles
 and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous ][  ][ black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these  ][ ][  
][ luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, ][  ][ that seemed almost of the same colour as the  ][ 
dun-white sockets in which ][  ][ they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips. ][  ][ The different acciden
 ][ ts of life are not so changeable as the feelings ][  ][ of human nature.  I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the so
le ] ][ [  ][ purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.  For this I had ][  ][ deprived myself of rest and health.  I had
 desired ][  it with an ardour ][  ][ that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty ][  ][ of the dream 
vanished, an ][ d breathless horror and disgust filled my ][  ][ heart.  Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created,
 I ][  ][ rushed ][  out of the room and continued a long time traversing my ][  ][ bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sl
eep.  At length lass ][ itude ][  ][ succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the ][  ][ bed in my cl
othes, endeavouring to s ][ eek a few moments of forgetfulness. ][  ][ But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed 
by the wildest ][  ][ dreams ][ .  I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in ][  ][ the streets of Ingolstad
t.  Delighted and surprised, I e ][ mbraced her, ][  ][ but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with ][
  ][ the hue of death; her features  ][ appeared to change, and I thought that I ][  ][ held the corpse of my dead mother in my 
arms; a shroud enveloped her ][  ][ form ][ , and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. ][  ][ I started f
rom my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered ][  my forehead, my ][  ][ teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, 
by the dim and ][  ][ yellow light of the moon,  ][ as it forced its way through the window ][  ][ shutters, I beheld the wretch
--the miserable monster whom I had ][  ][ created.   ][ He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they ][  ][ may
 be called, were fixed on me.  His jaws opened, and he m ][ uttered some ][  ][ inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his c
heeks.  He might have ][  ][ spoken, but I did not hear; one ][  hand was stretched out, seemingly to ][  ][ detain me, but I es
caped and rushed downstairs.  I took refuge in the ][  ][ courty ][ ard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remain
ed ][  ][ during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the g ][ reatest ][  ][ agitation, listening attentively, catchin
g and fearing each sound as if ][  ][ it were to announce the approach o ][ f the demoniacal corpse to which I ][  ][ had so mis
erably given life. ][  ][ Oh!  No mortal could support the horror of that co ][ untenance.  A mummy ][  ][ again endued with ani
mation could not be so hideous as that wretch.  I ][  ][ had gazed on him while  ][ unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those
 ][  ][ muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing ][  ][ ][  such as even Dante could not have conce
ived. ][  ][ I passed the night wretchedly.  Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and ][   ][ ][ hardly that I felt the palpitatio
n of every artery; at others, I nearly ][  ][ sank to the ground through languor and extreme ][  weakness.  Mingled with ][  ][ 
this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had ][  ][ been my food and pl ][ easant rest for so long a sp
ace were now become a ][  ][ hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete! ][  ][  ][ Morning, dismal and 
wet, at length dawned and discovered to my ][  ][ sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, it ][ s white steeple ][  
][ and clock, which indicated the sixth hour.  The porter opened the gates ][  ][ of the court, which had th ][ at night been my
 asylum, and I issued into ][  ][ the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the ][  ][  ][ wretch whom 
I feared every turning of the street would present to my ][  ][ view.  I did not dare return to the apartment which  ][ I inhabi
ted, but ][  ][ felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured ][  ][ from a black and comfortles ][ s sk
y. ][  ][ I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by ][  ][ bodily exercise to ease the load that wei ][ 
ghed upon my mind.  I ][  ][ traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or ][  ][ what I was doing.  My h
 ][ eart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I ][  ][ hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me: ][  ][  
 Lik ][ e one who, on a lonely road, ][  ][   Doth walk in fear and dread, ][  ][   And, having once turned round, walks on, ][ 
 ][   An ][ d turns no more his head; ][  ][   Because he knows a frightful fiend ][  ][   Doth close behind him tread. ][  ][  
 [Coleridge' ][ s "Ancient Mariner."] ][  ][ Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the ][  ][ various d
iligences and ca ][ rriages usually stopped.  Here I paused, I ][  ][ knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fix
ed on a coach ][  ][ ][  that was coming towards me from the other end of the street.  As it ][  ][ drew nearer I observed that 
it was the Swiss diligen ][ ce; it stopped just ][  ][ where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry ][ 
 ][ Clerval, who, on seeing  ][ me, instantly sprung out.  "My dear ][  ][ Frankenstein," exclaimed he, "how glad I am to see yo
u!  How fortunate ][  ][ that yo ][ u should be here at the very moment of my alighting!" ][  ][ Nothing could equal my delight 
on seeing Clerval; his presence brou ][ ght ][  ][ back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home ][  ][
 so dear to my recollection.  I grasped  ][ his hand, and in a moment forgot ][  ][ my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, a
nd for the first time ][  ][ during many mon ][ ths, calm and serene joy.  I welcomed my friend, ][  ][ therefore, in the most c
ordial manner, and we walked towards my ][  ][ c ][ ollege.  Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual ][  ][ fri
ends and his own good fortune in being permitted to  ][ come to ][  ][ Ingolstadt.  "You may easily believe," said he, "how grea
t was the ][  ][ difficulty to persuade my father that a ][ ll necessary knowledge was not ][  ][ comprised in the noble art of 
book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I ][  ][ left him incre ][ dulous to the last, for his constant answer to my ][  ][ unweari
ed entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in  ][ ][  ][ The Vicar of Wakefield:  'I have ten thousand florins
 a year without ][  ][ Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.'  But hi ][ s affection for me at ][  ][ length overcame his dislike
 of learning, and he has permitted me to ][  ][ undertake a voyage of di ][ scovery to the land of knowledge." ][  ][ "It gives 
me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left ][  ][ my fathe ][ r, brothers, and Elizabeth." ][  ][ "Very well, 
and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from ][  ][ you so seldom.   ][ By the by, I mean to lecture you a little up
on their ][  ][ account myself.  But, my dear Frankenstein," continued he, stopping  ][ ][  ][ short and gazing full in my face,
 "I did not before remark how very ill ][  ][ you appear; so thin and pale; you look as  ][ if you had been watching for ][  ][ 
several nights." ][  ][ "You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one ][  ][  ][ occupation that I have n
ot allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; ][  ][ but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all the ][ se employments are now at an
 ][  ][ end and that I am at length free." ][  ][ I trembled excessively; I could not endure to thin ][ k of, and far less to ][
  ][ allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night.  I walked with a ][  ][ quick pace, and we soon  ][ arrived at my colleg
e.  I then reflected, and ][  ][ the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my ][  ][  ][ apartment might 
still be there, alive and walking about.  I dreaded to ][  ][ behold this monster, but I feared still more that  ][ Henry should
 see him. ][  ][ Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the ][  ][ stairs, I darted up  ][ towards 
my own room.  My hand was already on the ][  ][ lock of the door before I recollected myself.  I then paused, and a ][   ][ ][ c
old shivering came over me.  I threw the door forcibly open, as ][  ][ children are accustomed to do when they expect a spec ][ 
tre to stand in ][  ][ waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.  I stepped ][  ][ fearfully in:  the apartment 
 ][ was empty, and my bedroom was also freed ][  ][ from its hideous guest.  I could hardly believe that so great a good ][  ][ 
fort ][ une could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy ][  ][ had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy a
nd ran d ][ own to Clerval. ][  ][ We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; ][  ][ but I was unabl
e to contain ][  myself.  It was not joy only that possessed ][  ][ me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and
 my pulse ][  ][ ][  beat rapidly.  I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same ][  ][ place; I jumped over the chai
rs, clapped my hands ][ , and laughed aloud. ][  ][ Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, ][  ][
 but when he observed me ][  more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes ][  ][ for which he could not account, and my loud, 
unrestrained, heartless ][   ][ ][ laughter frightened and astonished him. ][  ][ "My dear Victor," cried he, "what, for God's s
ake, is the matter?  Do ][  ][ n ][ ot laugh in that manner.  How ill you are!  What is the cause of all ][  ][ this?" ][  ][ "D
o not ask me," cried I, putting my h ][ ands before my eyes, for I ][  ][ thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room;
 "HE can tell. ][  ][ Oh, save me!  Save ][  me!"  I imagined that the monster seized me; I ][  ][ struggled furiously and fell 
down in a fit. ][  ][ Poor Clerval!  What mu ][ st have been his feelings?  A meeting, which he ][  ][ anticipated with such joy
, so strangely turned to bitterness.  But I ][   ][ ][ was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not ][  ][ r
ecover my senses for a long, long time. ][  ][ This  ][ was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for ][  ][ sev
eral months.  During all that time Henry was my only nur ][ se.  I ][  ][ afterwards learned that, knowing my father's advanced 
age and unfitness ][  ][ for so long a journey, and how wret ][ ched my sickness would make ][  ][ Elizabeth, he spared them thi
s grief by concealing the extent of my ][  ][ disorder.  He knew ][  that I could not have a more kind and attentive ][  ][ nurs
e than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he ][  ][  ][ did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he perfor
med the kindest ][  ][ action that he could towards them. ][  ][ But I w ][ as in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the u
nbounded and ][  ][ unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored  ][ me to life. ][  ][ The form of the monster on wh
om I had bestowed existence was forever ][  ][ before my eyes, and I raved inces ][ santly concerning him.  Doubtless my ][  ][ 
words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings ][  ][ of my d ][ isturbed imagination, but the pertinacit
y with which I ][  ][ continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my dis ][ order ][  ][ indeed owed its origin 
to some uncommon and terrible event. ][  ][ By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses ][  that alarmed and ][  ][ grieved
 my friend, I recovered.  I remember the first time I became ][  ][ capable of observing outward ][  objects with any kind of pl
easure, I ][  ][ perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young ][  ][ buds wer ][ e shooting forth from th
e trees that shaded my window.  It was ][  ][ a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my  ][ ][  ][ convalescence
.  I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in ][  ][ my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a sho ][ rt time I became
 as ][  ][ cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion. ][  ][ "Dearest Clerval," exclaimed I, "how k ][ ind, how ver
y good you are to me. ][  ][ This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised ][  ][ yourself, ha ][ s been c
onsumed in my sick room.  How shall I ever repay ][  ][ you?  I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of whic ][ h I 
][  ][ have been the occasion, but you will forgive me." ][  ][ "You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yoursel ][ 
f, but get ][  ][ well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I ][  ][ may speak to you on one subject, 
 ][ may I not?" ][  ][ I trembled.  One subject!  What could it be?  Could he allude to an ][  ][ object on whom I dared not eve
n th ][ ink?  "Compose yourself," said ][  ][ Clerval, who observed my change of colour, "I will not mention it if it ][  ][ agi
tates yo ][ u; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they ][  ][ received a letter from you in your own handwriting.
  They hardl ][ y know ][  ][ how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence." ][  ][ "Is that all, my dear Henry?  H
ow could you sup ][ pose that my first ][  ][ thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and ][  ][ who 
are so deserving of  ][ my love?" ][  ][ "If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to ][  ][ see a le
tter that has been lying ][  here some days for you; it is from ][  ][ your cousin, I believe." ][  ][ Chapter 6 ][  ][ Clerval 
then put the following lette ][ r into my hands.  It was from my ][  ][ own Elizabeth: ][  ][ "My dearest Cousin, ][  ][ "You ha
ve been ill, very ill, and even  ][ the constant letters of dear ][  ][ kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your acc
ount.  You are ][  ][ forbidden to w ][ rite--to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, ][  ][ is necessary to calm our
 apprehensions.  For a long time I have  ][ thought ][  ][ that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have ][  ][ 
restrained my uncle from undertaking a journ ][ ey to Ingolstadt.  I have ][  ][ prevented his encountering the inconveniences a
nd perhaps dangers of so ][  ][ long a journey,  ][ yet how often have I regretted not being able to ][  ][ perform it myself!  
I figure to myself that the task of attending on ][  ][  ][ your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could nev
er ][  ][ guess your wishes nor minister to them with th ][ e care and affection of ][  ][ your poor cousin.  Yet that is over n
ow:  Clerval writes that indeed ][  ][ you are getting bette ][ r.  I eagerly hope that you will confirm this ][  ][ intelligenc
e soon in your own handwriting. ][  ][ "Get well--and return to  ][ us.  You will find a happy, cheerful home and ][  ][ friends
 who love you dearly.  Your father's health is vigorous, and he ][   ][ ][ asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are w
ell; and not a ][  ][ care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.   ][ How pleased you would ][  ][ be to remark the improv
ement of our Ernest!  He is now sixteen and full ][  ][ of activity and spir ][ it.  He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to en
ter ][  ][ into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his ][  ][  ][ elder brother returns to us.  My unc
le is not pleased with the idea of ][  ][ a military career in a distant country, bu ][ t Ernest never had your ][  ][ powers of
 application.  He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his ][  ][ time is spent in the  ][ open air, climbing the hills or rowi
ng on the ][  ][ lake.  I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point ][  ][ ][  and permit him to enter on the 
profession which he has selected. ][  ][ "Little alteration, except the growth of our dear child ][ ren, has taken ][  ][ place 
since you left us.  The blue lake and snow-clad mountains--they ][  ][ never change; and I think our ][  placid home and our con
tented hearts are ][  ][ regulated by the same immutable laws.  My trifling occupations take up ][  ][ m ][ y time and amuse me,
 and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing ][  ][ none but happy, kind faces around me.  Since you left  ][ us, but one ][  
][ change has taken place in our little household.  Do you remember on ][  ][ what occasion Justine Moritz enter ][ ed our famil
y?  Probably you do not; ][  ][ I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.  Madame Moritz, ][  ][ her moth ][ er, was 
a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the ][  ][ third.  This girl had always been the favourite of her father ][ , bu
t ][  ][ through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and ][  ][ after the death of M. Moritz, treated her ][ 
 very ill.  My aunt observed ][  ][ this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother ][  ][ to allow her 
 ][ to live at our house.  The republican institutions of our ][  ][ country have produced simpler and happier manners than thos
e wh ][ ich ][  ][ prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.  Hence there is less ][  ][ distinction between the several
 classes ][  of its inhabitants; and the ][  ][ lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are ][  ][ mo
re refined a ][ nd moral.  A servant in Geneva does not mean the same ][  ][ thing as a servant in France and England.  Justine,
 thus received i ][ n ][  ][ our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our ][  ][ fortunate country, do
es not include the i ][ dea of ignorance and a ][  ][ sacrifice of the dignity of a human being. ][  ][ "Justine, you may rememb
er, was a great favourit ][ e of yours; and I ][  ][ recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one ][  ][ g
lance from Justine could dis ][ sipate it, for the same reason that ][  ][ Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica--she 
looked so ][  ][ frank-hearted a ][ nd happy.  My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, ][  ][ by which she was induced to 
give her an education superior to th ][ at ][  ][ which she had at first intended.  This benefit was fully repaid; ][  ][ Justin
e was the most grateful little creature  ][ in the world:  I do not ][  ][ mean that she made any professions I never heard one 
pass her lips, but ][  ][ you could see by h ][ er eyes that she almost adored her protectress. ][  ][ Although her disposition 
was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, ][   ][ ][ yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.  She ][ 
 ][ thought her the model of all excellence and ende ][ avoured to imitate her ][  ][ phraseology and manners, so that even now 
she often reminds me of her. ][  ][ "When my dearest aun ][ t died every one was too much occupied in their own ][  ][ grief to 
notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness ][  ][  ][ with the most anxious affection.  Poor Justine was very 
ill; but other ][  ][ trials were reserved for her. ][  ][ "One  ][ by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with t
he ][  ][ exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.   ][ The ][  ][ conscience of the woman was troubled; she beg
an to think that the ][  ][ deaths of her favourites was a judgement fro ][ m heaven to chastise her ][  ][ partiality.  She was
 a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor ][  ][ confirmed the idea whi ][ ch she had conceived.  Accordingly, a few months
 ][  ][ after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her ][   ][ ][ repentant mother.  Poor girl!  She wept w
hen she quitted our house; she ][  ][ was much altered since the death of my aunt; g ][ rief had given softness ][  ][ and a win
ning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable ][  ][ for vivacity.  Nor ][  was her residence at her mother's h
ouse of a nature ][  ][ to restore her gaiety.  The poor woman was very vacillating in her ] ][ [  ][ repentance.  She sometimes
 begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, ][  ][ but much oftener accused her of having caused  ][ the deaths of her ][  ][ bro
thers and sister.  Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz ][  ][ into a decline, which at  ][ first increased her irri
tability, but she is ][  ][ now at peace for ever.  She died on the first approach of cold weather, ][   ][ ][ at the beginning 
of this last winter.  Justine has just returned to us; ][  ][ and I assure you I love her tenderly.  She is  ][ very clever and 
gentle, ][  ][ and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her ][  ][ expression continually remin ][ d me of my d
ear aunt. ][  ][ "I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling ][  ][ William.  I wish you  ][ could se
e him; he is very tall of his age, with ][  ][ sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair.  When he ][   ][ ][ s
miles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with ][  ][ health.  He has already had one or two little WIV ][ 
ES, but Louisa Biron ][  ][ is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age. ][  ][ "Now, dear Victor, I dare say yo
 ][ u wish to be indulged in a little ][  ][ gossip concerning the good people of Geneva.  The pretty Miss Mansfield ][  ][ has 
alre ][ ady received the congratulatory visits on her approaching ][  ][ marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. 
 Her ugl ][ y ][  ][ sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your ][  ][ favourite schoolfellow, Loui
s Manoir, ha ][ s suffered several misfortunes ][  ][ since the departure of Clerval from Geneva.  But he has already ][  ][ rec
overed his spiri ][ ts, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a ][  ][ lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.  Sh
e is a widow, and mu ][ ch ][  ][ older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with ][  ][ everybody. ][  ][
 "I have written myself  ][ into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety ][  ][ returns upon me as I conclude.  Write, deare
st Victor,--one line--one ][ ][   ][ word will be a blessing to us.  Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his ][  ][ kindness, his a
ffection, and his many letters;  ][ we are sincerely ][  ][ grateful.  Adieu!  my cousin; take care of your self; and, I entreat
 ][  ][ you, write! ][  ][ "Elizabet ][ h Lavenza. ][  ][ "Geneva, March 18, 17--." ][  ][ "Dear, dear Elizabeth!" I exclaimed, 
when I had read her letter:  "I ][  ][ w ][ ill write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel." ][  ][ I wrot
e, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; bu ][ t my convalescence ][  ][ had commenced, and proceeded regularly.  In another fo
rtnight I was ][  ][ able to leave my chamber. ] ][ [  ][ One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the 
][  ][ several professors of the university.  In doi ][ ng this, I underwent a ][  ][ kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wou
nds that my mind had ][  ][ sustained.  Ever since the f ][ atal night, the end of my labours, and the ][  ][ beginning of my mi
sfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even ][  ][ t ][ o the name of natural philosophy.  When I was otherwise quite re
stored ][  ][ to health, the sight of a chemical instrument woul ][ d renew all the agony ][  ][ of my nervous symptoms.  Henry 
saw this, and had removed all my ][  ][ apparatus from my view.  He  ][ had also changed my apartment; for he ][  ][ perceived t
hat I had acquired a dislike for the room which had ][  ][ previously be ][ en my laboratory.  But these cares of Clerval were m
ade of ][  ][ no avail when I visited the professors.  M. Waldman inflicted  ][ torture ][  ][ when he praised, with kindness an
d warmth, the astonishing progress I ][  ][ had made in the sciences.  He soon p ][ erceived that I disliked the ][  ][ subject;
 but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to ][  ][ modesty, and c ][ hanged the subject from my improvement, 
to the science ][  ][ itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.  Wha ][ t ][  ][ could I do?  He meant to pl
ease, and he tormented me.  I felt as if he ][  ][ had placed carefully, one by one, in my v ][ iew those instruments which ][  
][ were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.  I ][  ][ writhed under h ][ is words, yet dared not exhi
bit the pain I felt. ][  ][ Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the ][  ][  ][ sensations of others
, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his ][  ][ total ignorance; and the conversation took a mor ][ e general turn.  I ]
[  ][ thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.  I saw plainly ][  ][ that he was surprised, but ][  he never attemp
ted to draw my secret from ][  ][ me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence ][  ][  ][ that knew no
 bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in ][  ][ him that event which was so often present to my reco ][ llection
, but which ][  ][ I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply. ][  ][ M. Krempe was not equally docil ][ e; a
nd in my condition at that time, of ][  ][ almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me ][  ][ even ][ 
 more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman.  "D--n ][  ][ the fellow!" cried he; "why, M. Clerval, I assure you he
 ][  has outstript ][  ][ us all.  Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.  A ][  ][ youngster who, but a few year
s ag ][ o, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as ][  ][ firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the ][  ][ univer
sity; an ][ d if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of ][  ][ countenance.--Ay, ay," continued he, observing my fac
e expressive ][  of ][  ][ suffering, "M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young ][  ][ man.  Young men should 
be diffident of  ][ themselves, you know, M. ][  ][ Clerval:  I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short ][  ][
 time." ][  ][ M. Kr ][ empe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned ][  ][ the conversation from a subject
 that was so annoying to ][  me. ][  ][ Clerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science; and his ][  ][ literary 
pursuits differed wholly fro ][ m those which had occupied me.  He ][  ][ came to the university with the design of making himse
lf complete ][  ][ master of the ][  oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for ][  ][ the plan of life he had mark
ed out for himself.  Resolved to pur ][ sue no ][  ][ inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording ][  ][
 scope for his spirit of enterprise.  Th ][ e Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit ][  ][ languages engaged his attention, and I was ea
sily induced to enter on ][  ][ the same stu ][ dies.  Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I ][  ][ wished to fly
 from reflection, and hated my former studies, I ][  felt ][  ][ great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and foun
d not ][  ][ only instruction but consolation in the ][  works of the orientalists.  I ][  ][ did not, like him, attempt a criti
cal knowledge of their dialects, for ][  ][ I did not co ][ ntemplate making any other use of them than temporary ][  ][ amuseme
nt.  I read merely to understand their meaning, and they wel ][ l ][  ][ repaid my labours.  Their melancholy is soothing, and t
heir joy ][  ][ elevating, to a degree I never experienced in st ][ udying the authors of ][  ][ any other country.  When you re
ad their writings, life appears to ][  ][ consist in a warm sun and  ][ a garden of roses,--in the smiles and frowns ][  ][ of a
 fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.  How ][  ][ diff ][ erent from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece a
nd Rome! ][  ][ Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Ge ][ neva was ][  ][ fixed for the latter end of autu
mn; but being delayed by several ][  ][ accidents, winter and snow arrived, the  ][ roads were deemed impassable, ][  ][ and my 
journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.  I felt this ][  ][ delay very bitter ][ ly; for I longed to see my native town a
nd my beloved ][  ][ friends.  My return had only been delayed so long, from an ][  ][ u ][ nwillingness to leave Clerval in a s
trange place, before he had become ][  ][ acquainted with any of its inhabitants.  The winte ][ r, however, was spent ][  ][ che
erfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came ][  ][ its beauty compensated ][  for its dilatoriness. ][  ]
[ The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily ][  ][ which was to fix th ][ e date of my departure, 
when Henry proposed a ][  ][ pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a ][  ][ pe ][ rsonal farewell to t
he country I had so long inhabited.  I acceded ][  ][ with pleasure to this proposition:  I was fond of exer ][ cise, and Clerva
l ][  ][ had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature ][  ][ that I had taken among the s ][ cenes of my 
native country. ][  ][ We passed a fortnight in these perambulations:  my health and spirits ][  ][ had long been re ][ stored, 
and they gained additional strength from the ][  ][ salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, an ][ d ][
  ][ the conversation of my friend.  Study had before secluded me from the ][  ][ intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and re ][ 
ndered me unsocial; but ][  ][ Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught ][  ][ me to love the aspec
 ][ t of nature, and the cheerful faces of children. ][  ][ Excellent friend!  how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to ]
[  ] ][ [ elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.  A selfish ][  ][ pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until yo
ur gentl ][ eness and ][  ][ affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature ][  ][ who, a few years ago
, loved and  ][ beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. ][  ][ When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the 
most ][  ][ deli ][ ghtful sensations.  A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ][  ][ ecstasy.  The present season was i
ndeed divine; the fl ][ owers of spring ][  ][ bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud.  I ][  ][ was u
ndisturbed by thoughts w ][ hich during the preceding year had pressed ][  ][ upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw th
em off, with an ][  ][ invin ][ cible burden. ][  ][ Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: ][  
][ he exerted himself to amuse m ][ e, while he expressed the sensations that ][  ][ filled his soul.  The resources of his mind
 on this occasion were truly ][  ][  ][ astonishing:  his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, ][  ][ in imitat
ion of the Persian and Arabic writers, h ][ e invented tales of ][  ][ wonderful fancy and passion.  At other times he repeated 
my favourite ][  ][ poems, or drew me out in ][ to arguments, which he supported with great ][  ][ ingenuity.  We returned to ou
r college on a Sunday afternoon:  the ][  ][ pea ][ sants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy.  My ][  ][ 
own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feel ][ ings of unbridled ][  ][ joy and hilarity. ][  ][ Chapter 7 ][  ][ On my
 return, I found the following letter from my father:--  ][ ][  ][ "My dear Victor, ][  ][ "You have probably waited impatiently
 for a letter to fix the date of ][  ][ your return to us; a ][ nd I was at first tempted to write only a few ][  ][ lines, mere
ly mentioning the day on which I should expect you.  But ][  ][  ][ that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.  What 
would be ][  ][ your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and ][  glad welcome, to ][  ][ behold, on the contrary, tears 
and wretchedness?  And how, Victor, can ][  ][ I relate our misfortune?  ][  Absence cannot have rendered you callous to ][  ][ 
our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent ][  ][ s ][ on?  I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, 
but I know it is ][  ][ impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to see ][ k the words ][  ][ which are to convey to yo
u the horrible tidings. ][  ][ "William is dead!--that sweet child, whose smiles del ][ ighted and warmed ][  ][ my heart, who w
as so gentle, yet so gay!  Victor, he is murdered! ][  ][ "I will not attempt to console ][  you; but will simply relate the ][ 
 ][ circumstances of the transaction. ][  ][ "Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your ][  two brothers, went to ][  ][ wa
lk in Plainpalais.  The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged ][  ][ our walk farther th ][ an usual.  It was already du
sk before we thought of ][  ][ returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had go ][ ne ][  ][ on before, wer
e not to be found.  We accordingly rested on a seat until ][  ][ they should return.  Presently Ernest c ][ ame, and enquired if
 we had seen ][  ][ his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William ][  ][ had run awa ][ y to hide himsel
f, and that he vainly sought for him, and ][  ][ afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.  ][ ][  ][ "This
 account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him ][  ][ until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured t ][ hat he m
ight have ][  ][ returned to the house.  He was not there.  We returned again, with ][  ][ torches; for I could not rest ][ , wh
en I thought that my sweet boy had ][  ][ lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; ][  ][ Elizabeth ][ 
 also suffered extreme anguish.  About five in the morning I ][  ][ discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen b
 ][ looming and ][  ][ active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the ][  ][ print of the murder's finger wa
s on ][  his neck. ][  ][ "He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my ][  ][ countenance betrayed the secret t
o Elizab ][ eth.  She was very earnest to ][  ][ see the corpse.  At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, ][  ][ 
and entering ][  the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the ][  ][ victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, 'O God
!  I have murder ][ ed my ][  ][ darling child!' ][  ][ "She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.  When she again 
][  ][ lived, it was ][  only to weep and sigh.  She told me, that that same ][  ][ evening William had teased her to let him we
ar a very valuable ][  ] ][ [ miniature that she possessed of your mother.  This picture is gone, and ][  ][ was doubtless the t
emptation which urged the mu ][ rderer to the deed.  We ][  ][ have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discov
er him ][  ][ are unremitted; bu ][ t they will not restore my beloved William! ][  ][ "Come, dearest Victor; you alone can cons
ole Elizabeth.  She weeps ][  ][ con ][ tinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; ][  ][ her words pierc
e my heart.  We are all unhappy; but wil ][ l not that be an ][  ][ additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comf
orter? ][  ][ Your dear mother!  Alas, Victo ][ r!  I now say, Thank God she did not live ][  ][ to witness the cruel, miserable
 death of her youngest darling! ][  ][ "Come, Vi ][ ctor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, ][  ][ but wi
th feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, ][  instead of ][  ][ festering, the wounds of our minds.  Enter the house 
of mourning, my ][  ][ friend, but with kindness and aff ][ ection for those who love you, and not ][  ][ with hatred for your e
nemies. ][  ][                "Your affectionate and afflict ][ ed father, ][  ][                               "Alphonse Franke
nstein. ][  ][ "Geneva, May 12th, 17--." ][  ][ Clerval, who had ][  watched my countenance as I read this letter, was ][  ][ su
rprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first ][  ][  ][ expressed on receiving new from my friends.  I threw
 the letter on the ][  ][ table, and covered my face with my hands. ][   ][ ][ "My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed Henry, when he 
perceived me weep with ][  ][ bitterness, "are you always to be unhappy?  My ][  dear friend, what has ][  ][ happened?" ][  ][ 
I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the ][  ][ room ][  in the extremest agitation.  Tears also gus
hed from the eyes of ][  ][ Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune. ][  ][ ][  "I can offer you no consolation, my fri
end," said he; "your disaster is ][  ][ irreparable.  What do you intend to do?" ][  ][  ][ "To go instantly to Geneva: come wit
h me, Henry, to order the horses." ][  ][ During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few  ][ words of consolation; ][  ][ he 
could only express his heartfelt sympathy.  "Poor William!" said he, ][  ][ "dear lovely child,  ][ he now sleeps with his angel
 mother!  Who that had ][  ][ seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his ][  ][  ][ untimely loss!  
To die so miserably; to feel the murderer's grasp!  How ][  ][ much more a murdered that could destroy r ][ adiant innocence!  P
oor little ][  ][ fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but ][  ][ he is at rest ][ . The pang is ov
er, his sufferings are at an end for ever. ][  ][ A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain.  He can no ][  longer ][  
][ be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable ][  ][ survivors." ][  ][ Clerval spoke thus as we  ][ hurried 
through the streets; the words ][  ][ impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in ][  ][ solitud ][ e.  
But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a ][  ][ cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend. ][  ][ My journey ][ 
 was very melancholy.  At first I wished to hurry on, for I ][  ][ longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing 
 ][ friends; ][  ][ but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress.  I could ][  ][ hardly sustain the multitude o
f fe ][ elings that crowded into my mind.  I ][  ][ passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen ][  ][ 
for near ][ ly six years.  How altered every thing might be during that ][  ][ time!  One sudden and desolating change had taken
 place; but  ][ a thousand ][  ][ little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, ][  ][ which, although th
ey were done mor ][ e tranquilly, might not be the less ][  ][ decisive.  Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thous
and ][  ][ nameless  ][ evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define ][  ][ them.  I remained two days at Lausann
e, in this painful state ][  of mind. ][  ][ I contemplated the lake:  the waters were placid; all around was calm; ][  ][ and t
he snowy mountains, 'the pal ][ aces of nature,' were not changed.  By ][  ][ degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, a
nd I continued my ][  ][ journey ][  towards Geneva. ][  ][ The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I ][ 
 ][ approached my native town.  I di ][ scovered more distinctly the black ][  ][ sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont B
lanc.  I wept like a ][  ][ child.  "Dea ][ r mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your ][  ][ wanderer?  Your s
ummits are clear; the sky and lake are blue  ][ and ][  ][ placid.  Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness
?" ][  ][ I fear, my friend, that I shall render ][  myself tedious by dwelling on ][  ][ these preliminary circumstances; but t
hey were days of comparative ][  ][ happiness, and I ][  think of them with pleasure.  My country, my beloved ][  ][ country! wh
o but a native can tell the delight I took in again ][   ][ ][ beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lov
ely ][  ][ lake! ][  ][ Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief an ][ d fear again overcame me.  Night ][  ][ also closed around; and 
when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I ][  ][ felt still  ][ more gloomily.  The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of
 ][  ][ evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become  ][ the most ][  ][ wretched of human beings.  Alas!  I prop
hesied truly, and failed only ][  ][ in one single circumstance, that in ][  all the misery I imagined and ][  ][ dreaded, I did
 not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was ][  ][ destined to end ][ ure.  It was completely dark when I arrived in t
he ][  ][ environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was ][  ][  ][ obliged to pass the night at Sechero
n, a village at the distance of ][  ][ half a league from the city.  The sky was ser ][ ene; and, as I was unable ][  ][ to rest
, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been ][  ][ murdered.  As I cou ][ ld not pass through the town, I was 
obliged to cross ][  ][ the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.  During this short voya ][ ge ][  ][ I saw the lightning pl
aying on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most ][  ][ beautiful figures.  The storm appeared to a ][ pproach rapidly, and, on ][ 
 ][ landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress.  It ][  ][ advanced; the heav ][ ens were clouded, and I 
soon felt the rain coming ][  ][ slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased. ][  ][ I qui ][ tted my seat, and wa
lked on, although the darkness and storm ][  ][ increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrifi ][ c crash ][  ][ o
ver my head.  It was echoed from Saleve, the Juras, and the Alps of ][  ][ Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning daz ][ zled my eyes
, illuminating the ][  ][ lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant ][  ][ every thing s ][ eemed of
 a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself ][  ][ from the preceding flash.  The storm, as is often the case in  ][ ][  
][ Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.  The ][  ][ most violent storm hung exactly north of the t ][ 
own, over the part of the ][  ][ lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of ][  ][ Copet.  Another sto
 ][ rm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another ][  ][ darkened and sometimes disclosed the Mole, a peaked mountain to t
he ] ][ [  ][ east of the lake. ][  ][ While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on ][  ][ with a hasty
 step.   ][ This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I ][  ][ clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, "William, dear angel!
 this is ][  ][  ][ thy funeral, this thy dirge!" As I said these words, I perceived in the ][  ][ gloom a figure which stole fr
om behind a clum ][ p of trees near me; I ][  ][ stood fixed, gazing intently:  I could not be mistaken.  A flash of ][  ][ ligh
tning illuminated th ][ e object, and discovered its shape plainly to ][  ][ me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its 
aspect more hideous ][   ][ ][ than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, ][  ][ the filthy daemon,
 to whom I had given life.   ][ What did he there?  Could ][  ][ he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brothe
r?  No ][  ][ sooner did that id ][ ea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of ][  ][ its truth; my teeth chattered, an
d I was forced to lean against a tre ][ e ][  ][ for support.  The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. ][  ][ 
Nothing in human shape could have destro ][ yed the fair child.  HE was the ][  ][ murderer!  I could not doubt it.  The mere pr
esence of the idea was an ][  ][ irresistibl ][ e proof of the fact.  I thought of pursuing the devil; but ][  ][ it would have 
been in vain, for another flash discovered him t ][ o me ][  ][ hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mo
nt ][  ][ Saleve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on  ][ the south.  He soon reached ][  ][ the summit, and disappeared. ][  ][ I
 remained motionless.  The thunder ceased; but the rain  ][ still ][  ][ continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrab
le darkness.  I ][  ][ revolved in my mind the events which  ][ I had until now sought to forget: ][  ][ the whole train of my p
rogress toward the creation; the appearance of ][  ][ the works  ][ of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.  Two years had
 ][  ][ now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first receive ][ d life; and ][  ][ was this his first crime?  Alas!  I h
ad turned loose into the world a ][  ][ depraved wretch, whose delight w ][ as in carnage and misery; had he not ][  ][ murdered
 my brother? ][  ][ No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the re ][ mainder of the ][  ][ night, which I spent, cold
 and wet, in the open air.  But I did not ][  ][ feel the inconvenience of the w ][ eather; my imagination was busy in ][  ][ sc
enes of evil and despair.  I considered the being whom I had cast ][  ][ among manki ][ nd, and endowed with the will and power 
to effect purposes ][  ][ of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in t ][ he light ][  ][ of my own vampire, m
y own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced ][  ][ to destroy all that was dear to me. ][  ][  ][ Day dawned; and I direct
ed my steps towards the town.  The gates were ][  ][ open, and I hastened to my father's house.  ][  My first thought was to ][ 
 ][ discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be ][  ][ made.  But I paused ][  when I reflected on the
 story that I had to tell. A ][  ][ being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at  ][ ][  ][ midnight amon
g the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.  I ][  ][ remembered also the nervous fever with which I had b ][ een seized just 
at ][  ][ the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of ][  ][ delirium to a tale otherwise  ][ so utterly i
mprobable.  I well knew that ][  ][ if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have ][  ][ looked ][  upon it
 as the ravings of insanity.  Besides, the strange nature ][  ][ of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were s ][ o fa
r credited ][  ][ as to persuade my relatives to commence it.  And then of what use would ][  ][ be pursuit?  Who could arre ][ 
st a creature capable of scaling the ][  ][ overhanging sides of Mont Saleve?  These reflections determined me, and ][  ][ I res
 ][ olved to remain silent. ][  ][ It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house.  I ][  ][ told the servant
s no ][ t to disturb the family, and went into the library ][  ][ to attend their usual hour of rising. ][  ][ Six years had ela
psed, pa ][ ssed in a dream but for one indelible trace, ][  ][ and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my fathe
r ][  ][ bef ][ ore my departure for Ingolstadt.  Beloved and venerable parent!  He ][  ][ still remained to me.  I gazed on the
 picture of my m ][ other, which stood ][  ][ over the mantel-piece.  It was an historical subject, painted at my ][  ][ father'
s desire, and repres ][ ented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of ][  ][ despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father.  Her g
arb was ][  ][ rustic, a ][ nd her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, ][  ][ that hardly permitted the sent
iment of pity.  Below this p ][ icture was a ][  ][ miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.  While ][  
][ I was thus engaged, Ernest en ][ tered:  he had heard me arrive, and ][  ][ hastened to welcome me:  "Welcome, my dearest Vic
tor," said he.  "Ah! I ][  ][ wish y ][ ou had come three months ago, and then you would have found us ][  ][ all joyous and del
ighted.  You come to us now to share a m ][ isery which ][  ][ nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our
 ][  ][ father, who seems sinking under his  ][ misfortune; and your persuasions ][  ][ will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her 
vain and tormenting ][  ][ self-accusations.--Po ][ or William! he was our darling and our pride!" ][  ][ Tears, unrestrained, f
ell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal ][  ][ ][  agony crept over my frame.  Before, I had only imagined the ][  ][ wret
chedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as ][  a new, and ][  ][ a not less terrible, disaster.  I tried to calm E
rnest; I enquired more ][  ][ minutely concerning my father, ][  and here I named my cousin. ][  ][ "She most of all," said Erne
st, "requires consolation; she accused ][  ][ herself of having  ][ caused the death of my brother, and that made her ][  ][ ver
y wretched.  But since the murderer has been discovered--" ][  ][ "T ][ he murderer discovered!  Good God! how can that be? who 
could attempt ][  ][ to pursue him?  It is impossible; one might as well ][  try to overtake the ][  ][ winds, or confine a moun
tain-stream with a straw.  I saw him too; he ][  ][ was free last night!" ][ ][   ][ "I do not know what you mean," replied my b
rother, in accents of ][  ][ wonder, "but to us the discovery we have made compl ][ etes our misery.  No ][  ][ one would believ
e it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be ][  ][ convinced, notwithstanding  ][ all the evidence.  Indeed, who would cre
dit ][  ][ that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, ][  ][ c ][ ould suddenly become so capable of s
o frightful, so appalling a crime?" ][  ][ "Justine Moritz!  Poor, poor girl, is she the acc ][ used?  But it is ][  ][ wrongful
ly; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?" ][  ][ "No one did at first; but  ][ several circumstances came o
ut, that have ][  ][ almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so ][  ][ conf ][ used, as to add to the e
vidence of facts a weight that, I fear, ][  ][ leaves no hope for doubt.  But she will be tried today, a ][ nd you will ][  ][ t
hen hear all." ][  ][ He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William ][  ][ had been  ][ discovered, Just
ine had been taken ill, and confined to her ][  ][ bed for several days.  During this interval, one of the serva ][ nts, ][  ][ 
happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the ][  ][ murder, had discovered in her pocket the pi ][ cture of
 my mother, which ][  ][ had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.  The servant ][  ][ instantly showed it t ][ o on
e of the others, who, without saying a word to ][  ][ any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, ] ][ 
[  ][ Justine was apprehended.  On being charged with the fact, the poor girl ][  ][ confirmed the suspicion in a great measure 
 ][ by her extreme confusion of ][  ][ manner. ][  ][ This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied ][  
][ e ][ arnestly, "You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.  Justine, poor, ][  ][ good Justine, is innocent." ][  ][ At that 
instant  ][ my father entered.  I saw unhappiness deeply impressed ][  ][ on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me c
heerfully; a ][ nd, ][  ][ after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced ][  ][ some other topic than that
 of our disaster ][ , had not Ernest exclaimed, ][  ][ "Good God, papa!  Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of ][  ]
[ poor William." ][  ][  ][ "We do also, unfortunately," replied my father, "for indeed I had ][  ][ rather have been for ever i
gnorant than have discov ][ ered so much ][  ][ depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly." ][  ][ "My dear father, yo
u are mistaken; Justine is i ][ nnocent." ][  ][ "If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.  She is to be ][  ][ t
ried today, and I hope, I sincer ][ ely hope, that she will be acquitted." ][  ][ This speech calmed me.  I was firmly convinced
 in my own mind that ][  ][ Justine, ][  and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.  I ][  ][ had no fear, ther
efore, that any circumstantial evidence  ][ could be ][  ][ brought forward strong enough to convict her.  My tale was not one t
o ][  ][ announce publicly; its astounding h ][ orror would be looked upon as ][  ][ madness by the vulgar.  Did any one indeed 
exist, except I, the ][  ][ creator, who would b ][ elieve, unless his senses convinced him, in the ][  ][ existence of the livi
ng monument of presumption and rash ignorance ][  ][ ][  which I had let loose upon the world? ][  ][ We were soon joined by Eli
zabeth.  Time had altered her since I last ][  ][ beheld ][  her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of ][
  ][ her childish years.  There was the same candour, the sa ][ me vivacity, but ][  ][ it was allied to an expression more full
 of sensibility and intellect. ][  ][ She welcomed me with the g ][ reatest affection.  "Your arrival, my dear ][  ][ cousin," s
aid she, "fills me with hope.  You perhaps will find some ][  ][ mea ][ ns to justify my poor guiltless Justine.  Alas! who is s
afe, if she ][  ][ be convicted of crime?  I rely on her innocence as ce ][ rtainly as I do ][  ][ upon my own.  Our misfortune 
is doubly hard to us; we have not only ][  ][ lost that lovely darling boy,  ][ but this poor girl, whom I sincerely ][  ][ love
, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.  If she is condemned, I ][  ][ never  ][ shall know joy more.  But she will not, I am
 sure she will not; ][  ][ and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death ][  of my little ][  ][ William." ][  ][ "S
he is innocent, my Elizabeth," said I, "and that shall be proved; ][  ][ fear nothing, b ][ ut let your spirits be cheered by th
e assurance of her ][  ][ acquittal." ][  ][ "How kind and generous you are! every one else  ][ believes in her guilt, ][  ][ an
d that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible:  and to ][  ][ see every one else pr ][ ejudiced in so deadly a mann
er rendered me ][  ][ hopeless and despairing."  She wept. ][  ][ "Dearest niece," said my father, " ][ dry your tears.  If she 
is, as you ][  ][ believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity ][  ][ with which ][  I shall prevent the
 slightest shadow of partiality." ][  ][ Chapter 8 ][  ][ We passed a few sad hours until eleven o'clock, wh ][ en the trial was
 to ][  ][ commence.  My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend ][  ][ as witnesses, I accomp ][ anied them t
o the court.  During the whole of ][  ][ this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.  It was to ][   ][ ][ be de
cided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would ][  ][ cause the death of two of my fellow beings:  o ][ ne a
 smiling babe full of ][  ][ innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every ][  ][ aggravation of inf ][ 
amy that could make the murder memorable in horror. ][  ][ Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promis
 ][ ed ][  ][ to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ][  ][ ignominious grave, and I the cause!  A thousa
nd t ][ imes rather would I ][  ][ have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I ][  ][ was absent when i
t was co ][ mmitted, and such a declaration would have ][  ][ been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have ][  
][ exculpate ][ d her who suffered through me. ][  ][ The appearance of Justine was calm.  She was dressed in mourning, and ][  
][ her countenan ][ ce, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her ][  ][ feelings, exquisitely beautiful.  Yet she 
appeared confident i ][ n ][  ][ innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by ][  ][ thousands, for all the
 kindness which her beau ][ ty might otherwise have ][  ][ excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the ][  ][ 
imagination of the enormity  ][ she was supposed to have committed.  She ][  ][ was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently
 constrained; and as ][  ][ her  ][ confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she ][  ][ worked up her mind to 
an appearance of courage.  When she  ][ entered the ][  ][ court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we wer
e ][  ][ seated.  A tear seemed to dim h ][ er eye when she saw us, but she quickly ][  ][ recovered herself, and a look of sorr
owful affection seemed to attest ][  ][ her  ][ utter guiltlessness. ][  ][ The trial began, and after the advocate against her 
had stated the ][  ][ charge, several witnesses  ][ were called.  Several strange facts combined ][  ][ against her, which might
 have staggered anyone who had not such proof ][  ][ ][  of her innocence as I had.  She had been out the whole of the night on 
][  ][ which the murder had been committed and towards m ][ orning had been ][  ][ perceived by a market-woman not far from the 
spot where the body of the ][  ][ murdered child had been af ][ terwards found.  The woman asked her what she ][  ][ did there, 
but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused ][  ] ][ [ and unintelligible answer.  She returned to the house abou
t eight ][  ][ o'clock, and when one inquired where she had passed t ][ he night, she ][  ][ replied that she had been looking f
or the child and demanded earnestly ][  ][ if anything had been heard co ][ ncerning him.  When shown the body, she ][  ][ fell 
into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.  The ][  ][ pictur ][ e was then produced which the servant had found 
in her pocket; ][  ][ and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it w ][ as the same ][  ][ which, an hour before the
 child had been missed, she had placed round ][  ][ his neck, a murmur of horror and ][  indignation filled the court. ][  ][ Ju
stine was called on for her defence.  As the trial had proceeded, her ][  ][ countenance ][  had altered.  Surprise, horror, and
 misery were strongly ][  ][ expressed.  Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when sh ][ e was ][  ][ desired to plead, s
he collected her powers and spoke in an audible ][  ][ although variable voice. ][  ][ "God know ][ s," she said, "how entirely 
I am innocent.  But I do not ][  ][ pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innoce ][ nce on ][  ][ a plain an
d simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced ][  ][ against me, and I hope the character I  ][ have always borne wi
ll incline ][  ][ my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears ][  ][ doubtful or ][  suspicious." ][
  ][ She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed ][  ][ the evening of the night on wh ][ ich the murd
er had been committed at the ][  ][ house of an aunt at Chene, a village situated at about a league from ][  ][ Gene ][ va.  On 
her return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man who asked ][  ][ her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost ][ .  S
he was ][  ][ alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, ][  ][ when the gates of Geneva were shut ][ 
, and she was forced to remain ][  ][ several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being ][  ][ unwilling to cal
 ][ l up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.  Most ][  ][ of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she bel
ieve ][ d that ][  ][ she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. ][  ][ It was dawn, and she quitted 
her asyl ][ um, that she might again endeavour ][  ][ to find my brother.  If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, ][ 
 ][ it was w ][ ithout her knowledge.  That she had been bewildered when ][  ][ questioned by the market-woman was not surprisin
g, since she had ][  passed ][  ][ a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. ][  ][ Concerning the pictu
re she could give no ][  account. ][  ][ "I know," continued the unhappy victim, "how heavily and fatally this ][  ][ one circum
stance weighs against me ][ , but I have no power of explaining ][  ][ it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am on
ly left to ][  ][ conjecture ][  concerning the probabilities by which it might have been ][  ][ placed in my pocket.  But here 
also I am checked.  I believe th ][ at I ][  ][ have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to ][  ][ d
estroy me wantonly.  Did the murdere ][ r place it there?  I know of no ][  ][ opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I h
ad, why should he have ][  ][ stolen the ][  jewel, to part with it again so soon? ][  ][ "I commit my cause to the justice of m
y judges, yet I see no room for ][  ][ hope. ][   I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my ][  ][ charact
er, and if their testimony shall not overweigh m ][ y supposed ][  ][ guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my sal
vation on my ][  ][ innocence." ][  ][ Several witne ][ sses were called who had known her for many years, and ][  ][ they spoke
 well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which  ][ they ][  ][ supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling
 to come ][  ][ forward.  Elizabeth saw even this last resou ][ rce, her excellent ][  ][ dispositions and irreproachable conduc
t, about to fail the accused, ][  ][ when, although violently ag ][ itated, she desired permission to address ][  ][ the court. 
][  ][ "I am," said she, "the cousin of the unhappy child who was mu ][ rdered, or ][  ][ rather his sister, for I was educated 
by and have lived with his ][  ][ parents ever since and even long befor ][ e his birth.  It may therefore be ][  ][ judged inde
cent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see ][  ][ a fellow  ][ creature about to perish through the cowardice o
f her ][  ][ pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say wh ][ at I ][  ][ know of her character.  I am wel
l acquainted with the accused.  I have ][  ][ lived in the same house with her, at o ][ ne time for five and at another ][  ][ f
or nearly two years.  During all that period she appeared to me the ][  ][ most amiable  ][ and benevolent of human creatures.  
She nursed Madame ][  ][ Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affec ][ tion ][  ][ and care and afterwa
rds attended her own mother during a tedious ][  ][ illness, in a manner that excited the admira ][ tion of all who knew her, ][
  ][ after which she again lived in my uncle's house, where she was beloved ][  ][ by all the family ][ .  She was warmly attach
ed to the child who is now ][  ][ dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother.  For my ow ][ n ][  ][ part, I do 
not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence ][  ][ produced against her, I believe and rely o ][ n her perfect in
nocence.  She ][  ][ had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the ][  ][ chief proof rest ][ s, if she ha
d earnestly desired it, I should have ][  ][ willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her." ][  ][ A ][  murmur 
of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful ][  ][ appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference,  ][ and 
not in ][  ][ favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with ][  ][ renewed violence, charging her w ][ 
ith the blackest ingratitude.  She ][  ][ herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.  My own ][  ][ agitation and 
 ][ anguish was extreme during the whole trial.  I believed ][  ][ in her innocence; I knew it.  Could the demon who had (I did 
not  ][ for a ][  ][ minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have ][  ][ betrayed the innocent to death and 
ignominy ][ ?  I could not sustain the ][  ][ horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and ][  ][ the
 countenance ][ s of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, ][  ][ I rushed out of the court in agony.  The torture
s of the accused ][  did ][  ][ not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of ][  ][ remorse tore my bosom an
d would not forgo th ][ eir hold. ][  ][ I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.  In the morning I went to ][  ][ the court;
 my lips and throat were ][  parched.  I dared not ask the fatal ][  ][ question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the c
ause of my ][  ][ visit.  Th ][ e ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine ][  ][ was condemned. ][  ][ I canno
t pretend to describe what I the ][ n felt.  I had before ][  ][ experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bes
tow upon ][  ][ them adequate expres ][ sions, but words cannot convey an idea of the ][  ][ heart-sickening despair that I then
 endured.  The person to whom I ][  ][ a ][ ddressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt. ][  ][ "That evi
dence," he observed, "was hardly required in ][  so glaring a ][  ][ case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges 
like to ][  ][ condemn a criminal upon circumsta ][ ntial evidence, be it ever so ][  ][ decisive." ][  ][ This was strange and 
unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?  Had ][ ][   ][ my eyes deceived me?  And was I really as mad as the whole world wo
uld ][  ][ believe me to be if I disclosed the object of ][  my suspicions?  I ][  ][ hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eag
erly demanded the result. ][  ][ "My cousin," replied I, "it ][  is decided as you may have expected; all ][  ][ judges had rath
er that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty ][  ][ s ][ hould escape.  But she has confessed." ][  ][ This was a dir
e blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness ][  ][ upon J ][ ustine's innocence.  "Alas!" said she.  "How shall I eve
r again ][  ][ believe in human goodness?  Justine, whom I loved and est ][ eemed as my ][  ][ sister, how could she put on thos
e smiles of innocence only to betray? ][  ][ Her mild eyes seemed incapable  ][ of any severity or guile, and yet she ][  ][ has
 committed a murder." ][  ][ Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expres ][ sed a desire to see ][  ][ my cousin.  My fa
ther wished her not to go but said that he left it to ][  ][ her own judgment and fe ][ elings to decide.  "Yes," said Elizabeth
, "I ][  ][ will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I ][   ][ ][ cannot go alone."  The idea of th
is visit was torture to me, yet I ][  ][ could not refuse.  We entered the gloomy prison cha ][ mber and beheld ][  ][ Justine s
itting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were ][  ][ manacled, and her head rested on  ][ her knees.  She rose on seei
ng us ][  ][ enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the ][  ][ feet of El ][ izabeth, weeping bitterl
y.  My cousin wept also. ][  ][ "Oh, Justine!" said she.  "Why did you rob me of my last consolation? ][ ][   ][ I relied on you
r innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I ][  ][ was not so miserable as I am now." ][  ][ "And  ][ do you also beli
eve that I am so very, very wicked?  Do you also ][  ][ join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a mur ][ derer?" Her 
][  ][ voice was suffocated with sobs. ][  ][ "Rise, my poor girl," said Elizabeth; "why do you kneel, if you are ][ ][   ][ inn
ocent?  I am not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless, ][  ][ notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard tha ][ t yo
u had yourself ][  ][ declared your guilt.  That report, you say, is false; and be assured, ][  ][ dear Justine, that nothin ][ 
g can shake my confidence in you for a moment, ][  ][ but your own confession." ][  ][ "I did confess, but I confessed a lie.  I
 ][  confessed, that I might ][  ][ obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than ][  ][ all my other 
sins ][ .  The God of heaven forgive me!  Ever since I was ][  ][ condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and men
aced, ][ ][   ][ until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I ][  ][ was.  He threatened excommunication 
and hell fir ][ e in my last moments if ][  ][ I continued obdurate.  Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked ][  ][ on 
me as a wretch d ][ oomed to ignominy and perdition.  What could I do? ][  ][ In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now onl
y am I truly ][  ][  ][ miserable." ][  ][ She paused, weeping, and then continued, "I thought with horror, my ][  ][ sweet lady
, that you should believ ][ e your Justine, whom your blessed ][  ][ aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a crea
ture capable ][  ][ of a cri ][ me which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated. ][  ][ Dear William! dearest blessed
 child!  I soon shall see you ag ][ ain in ][  ][ heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I ][  ][ a
m to suffer ignominy and death." ][  ][  ][ "Oh, Justine!  Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. ][  ][ Why did y
ou confess?  But do not mourn, dear girl ][ .  Do not fear.  I ][  ][ will proclaim, I will prove your innocence.  I will melt t
he stony ][  ][ hearts of your enemies by my ][  tears and prayers.  You shall not die! ][  ][ You, my playfellow, my companion,
 my sister, perish on the scaffold! ][  ][ No!   ][ No!  I never could survive so horrible a misfortune." ][  ][ Justine shook h
er head mournfully.  "I do not fear to die," she sai ][ d; ][  ][ "that pang is past.  God raises my weakness and gives me coura
ge to ][  ][ endure the worst.  I leave a sad and bitter ][  world; and if you remember ][  ][ me and think of me as of one unju
stly condemned, I am resigned to the ][  ][ fate awaiting me ][ .  Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to ][  ][ the
 will of heaven!" ][  ][ During this conversation I had retired  ][ to a corner of the prison room, ][  ][ where I could conceal
 the horrid anguish that possessed me.  Despair! ][  ][ Who dared ta ][ lk of that?  The poor victim, who on the morrow was to p
ass ][  ][ the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did ][ , such ][  ][ deep and bitter agony.  I gnashed my t
eeth and ground them together, ][  ][ uttering a groan that came from my inm ][ ost soul.  Justine started.  When ][  ][ she saw
 who it was, she approached me and said, "Dear sir, you are very ][  ][ kind to  ][ visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I
 am guilty?" ][  ][ I could not answer.  "No, Justine," said Elizabeth; "he is more  ][ ][  ][ convinced of your innocence than 
I was, for even when he heard that you ][  ][ had confessed, he did not credit it." ][   ][ ][ "I truly thank him.  In these las
t moments I feel the sincerest ][  ][ gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. ][   How sweet is ][  ][ the affect
ion of others to such a wretch as I am!  It removes more than ][  ][ half my misfortune, and I f ][ eel as if I could die in pea
ce now that my ][  ][ innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin." ][  ][ Thus the ][  poor sufferer tried to 
comfort others and herself.  She indeed ][  ][ gained the resignation she desired.  But I, the true murd ][ erer, felt the ][  ]
[ never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or ][  ][ consolation.  Elizabeth also wept a ][ nd was unhappy, 
but hers also was ][  ][ the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair ][  ][ moon, for ][  a while hid
es but cannot tarnish its brightness.  Anguish and ][  ][ despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a ][  hell wi
thin ][  ][ me which nothing could extinguish.  We stayed several hours with ][  ][ Justine, and it was with great diffi ][ cult
y that Elizabeth could tear ][  ][ herself away.  "I wish," cried she, "that I were to die with you; I ][  ][ cannot live in ][ 
 this world of misery." ][  ][ Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty ][  ][ repressed her bitter tea
 ][ rs.  She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice ][  ][ of half-suppressed emotion, "Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,
 ][  ][  ][ my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and ][  ][ preserve you; may this be the last misfortun
e that y ][ ou will ever ][  ][ suffer!  Live, and be happy, and make others so." ][  ][ And on the morrow Justine died.  Elizab
eth's heart- ][ rending eloquence ][  ][ failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the ][  ][ criminality of th
e saintly suffer ][ er.  My passionate and indignant ][  ][ appeals were lost upon them.  And when I received their cold answers
 ][  ][ and heard th ][ e harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed ][  ][ avowal died away on my lips.  Thus I might
 proclaim myself a madma ][ n, ][  ][ but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.  She ][  ][ perished on the sc
affold as a murderess! ][  ] ][ [ From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and ][  ][ voiceless grief
 of my Elizabeth.  This also was ][  my doing!  And my ][  ][ father's woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all 
was ][  ][ the work of my thrice-acc ][ ursed hands!  Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these ][  ][ are not your last tears!  Again sh
all you raise the funeral wail, and ][   ][ ][ the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard! ][  ][ Frankenstei
n, your son, your kinsman, your early, much- ][ loved friend; he ][  ][ who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes,
 who has no ][  ][ thought nor sense of joy exce ][ pt as it is mirrored also in your dear ][  ][ countenances, who would fill t
he air with blessings and spend his life ][  ][ in s ][ erving you--he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond ][  
][ his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and  ][ if the destruction ][  ][ pause before the peace of the grave have s
ucceeded to your sad torments! ][  ][ Thus spoke my propheti ][ c soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, ][  ][ I behel
d those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and ][  ][  ][ Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed 
arts. ][  ][ Chapter 9 ][  ][ Nothing is more painful to the human m ][ ind than, after the feelings have ][  ][ been worked up 
by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of ][  ][ inaction an ][ d certainty which follows and deprives the soul both
 of hope ][  ][ and fear.  Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.  The b ][ lood flowed ][  ][ freely in my veins, but a wei
ght of despair and remorse pressed on my ][  ][ heart which nothing could remove ][ .  Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered ][  ]
[ like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond ][  ][ descripti ][ on horrible, and more, much more (I pers
uaded myself) was yet ][  ][ behind.  Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love ][  of virtue. ][  ][ I had begun life 
with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment ][  ][ when I should put them in prac ][ tice and make myself useful to m
y fellow ][  ][ beings.  Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience ][  ][ whic ][ h allowed me to look back up
on the past with self-satisfaction, and ][  ][ from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was sei ][ zed by remorse and ][  ]
[ the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures ][  ][ such as no language can ][  describe. ][  ][ Th
is state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never ][  ][ entirely recovered from the first sho ][ ck it had sustai
ned.  I shunned ][  ][ the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; ][  ][ solitude was m ][ y only conso
lation--deep, dark, deathlike solitude. ][  ][ My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my ][  ][  ][ disposit
ion and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the ][  ][ feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life ][  to 
inspire me with ][  ][ fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which ][  ][ brooded over me.  "Do yo ][ 
u think, Victor," said he, "that I do not ][  ][ suffer also?  No one could love a child more than I loved your ][  ][ brother"-
 ][ -tears came into his eyes as he spoke--"but is it not a duty ][  ][ to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting 
thei ][ r ][  ][ unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief?  It is also a duty ][  ][ owed to yourself, for excessive sor
row prev ][ ents improvement or ][  ][ enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no ][  ][ man is fit 
for society. ][ " ][  ][ This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I ][  ][ should have been the first to
 hide my grief a ][ nd console my friends if ][  ][ remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my ][  ][
 other sensations.   ][ Now I could only answer my father with a look of ][  ][ despair and endeavour to hide myself from his vi
ew. ][  ][ About this ti ][ me we retired to our house at Belrive.  This change was ][  ][ particularly agreeable to me.  The sh
utting of the gates regularl ][ y at ][  ][ ten o'clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that ][  ][ hour ha
d rendered our residence within  ][ the walls of Geneva very irksome ][  ][ to me.  I was now free.  Often, after the rest of th
e family had ][  ][ retired for the  ][ night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the ][  ][ water.  Sometimes, with my 
sails set, I was carried by the wind; an ][ d ][  ][ sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to ][ 
 ][ pursue its own course and gave way to my ][  own miserable reflections.  I ][  ][ was often tempted, when all was at peace a
round me, and I the only ][  ][ unquiet thing th ][ at wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and ][  ][ heavenly--if I excep
t some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and ][  ][ int ][ errupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore--often, ][ 
 ][ I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, ][  that the waters ][  ][ might close over me and my calamities foreve
r.  But I was restrained, ][  ][ when I thought of the heroi ][ c and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly ][  ][ loved, and who
se existence was bound up in mine.  I thought also of my ][  ][  ][ father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion 
leave them ][  ][ exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend ][  whom I had let loose ][  ][ among them? ][  ][ At these
 moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my ][  ][ m ][ ind only that I might afford them consolation and ha
ppiness.  But that ][  ][ could not be.  Remorse extinguished every hope.  I ][  had been the author ][  ][ of unalterable evils
, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I ][  ][ had created should pe ][ rpetrate some new wickedness.  I had an obsc
ure ][  ][ feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some ][  ][  ][ signal crime, which by its enormity shou
ld almost efface the ][  ][ recollection of the past.  There was always scope for fear s ][ o long as ][  ][ anything I loved re
mained behind.  My abhorrence of this fiend cannot ][  ][ be conceived.  When I thought of h ][ im I gnashed my teeth, my eyes b
ecame ][  ][ inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so ][  ][ thoug ][ htlessly bestowed.  When I r
eflected on his crimes and malice, my ][  ][ hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation.  I w ][ ould have made a ][  ][ 
pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I when there have ][  ][ precipitated him to their ba ][ se.  I wished to see
 him again, that I ][  ][ might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the ][  ][ deat ][ hs of William an
d Justine.  Our house was the house of mourning. My ][  ][ father's health was deeply shaken by the horror of th ][ e recent eve
nts. ][  ][ Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ][  ][ ordinary occupations; all ple ][ asure se
emed to her sacrilege toward the ][  ][ dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she ][  ][ sho ][ uld 
pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.  She was no longer ][  ][ that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with  ][ 
me on the banks ][  ][ of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.  The first ][  ][ of those sorrows which are
 ][  sent to wean us from the earth had visited ][  ][ her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles. ][  ][ "When 
I re ][ flect, my dear cousin," said she, "on the miserable death of ][  ][ Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its wo
rks as t ][ hey before ][  ][ appeared to me.  Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and ][  ][ injustice that I read in bo
oks or heard ][  from others as tales of ancient ][  ][ days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to 
][  ][ reason th ][ an to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men ][  ][ appear to me as monsters thirsting for e
ach other's blood.   ][ Yet I am ][  ][ certainly unjust.  Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and ][  ][ if she cou
ld have committed the cr ][ ime for which she suffered, assuredly ][  ][ she would have been the most depraved of human creature
s.  For the sake ][  ][ of a ][  few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, ][  ][ a child whom she had 
nursed from its birth, and appea ][ red to love as if ][  ][ it had been her own!  I could not consent to the death of any human
 ][  ][ being, but certainly I shoul ][ d have thought such a creature unfit to ][  ][ remain in the society of men.  But she wa
s innocent.  I know, I feel ][  ][ she w ][ as innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. ][  ][ Alas!  Victor
, when falsehood can look so like the truth, ][  who can ][  ][ assure themselves of certain happiness?  I feel as if I were wal
king on ][  ][ the edge of a precipice, towards  ][ which thousands are crowding and ][  ][ endeavouring to plunge me into the a
byss.  William and Justine were ][  ][ assassinated, ][  and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, ][  ][ and per
haps respected.  But even if I were condemned to suffer  ][ on the ][  ][ scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change place
s with such a ][  ][ wretch." ][  ][ I listened to this disc ][ ourse with the extremest agony.  I, not in deed, ][  ][ but in e
ffect, was the true murderer.  Elizabeth read my anguish in my ] ][ [  ][ countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, "My dear
est friend, you ][  ][ must calm yourself.  These events have affect ][ ed me, God knows how ][  ][ deeply; but I am not so wret
ched as you are.  There is an expression of ][  ][ despair, and sometime ][ s of revenge, in your countenance that makes me ][  
][ tremble.  Dear Victor, banish these dark passions.  Remember the ][  ][ f ][ riends around you, who centre all their hopes in
 you.  Have we lost ][  ][ the power of rendering you happy?  Ah!  While we love ][ , while we are ][  ][ true to each other, he
re in this land of peace and beauty, your native ][  ][ country, we may reap every t ][ ranquil blessing--what can disturb our ]
[  ][ peace?" ][  ][ And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every ][  ][  ][ other gift of fortune suffic
e to chase away the fiend that lurked in my ][  ][ heart?  Even as she spoke I drew near to  ][ her, as if in terror, lest at ][
  ][ that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her. ][  ][ Thus not the tenderne ][ ss of friendship, nor the be
auty of earth, nor of ][  ][ heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ][ ][   ][ ineffectual.  I was
 encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial ][  ][ influence could penetrate.  The wounded deer dragging ][  its fainting ][  ][
 limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had ][  ][ pierced it, and to die, was bu ][ t a type of me. 
][  ][ Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but ][  ][ sometimes the whirlwind pa ][ ssions of my
 soul drove me to seek, by bodily ][  ][ exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable ][  ][ sen ][ sations.
  It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left ][  ][ my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine ][  val
leys, sought ][  ][ in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and ][  ][ my ephemeral, because huma ][ 
n, sorrows.  My wanderings were directed ][  ][ towards the valley of Chamounix.  I had visited it frequently during my ][  ][ b
 ][ oyhood.  Six years had passed since then:  _I_ was a wreck, but nought ][  ][ had changed in those savage and enduring scene
s. ] ][ [  ][ I performed the first part of my journey on horseback.  I afterwards ][  ][ hired a mule, as the more sure-footed 
and leas ][ t liable to receive ][  ][ injury on these rugged roads.  The weather was fine; it was about the ][  ][ middle of th
e month of A ][ ugust, nearly two months after the death of ][  ][ Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. 
 The ][  ][ weig ][ ht upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in ][  ][ the ravine of Arve.  The immense 
mountains and precip ][ ices that overhung ][  ][ me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and ][  ][ th
e dashing of the waterfa ][ lls around spoke of a power mighty as ][  ][ Omnipotence--and I ceased to fear or to bend before any
 being less ][  ][ almighty  ][ than that which had created and ruled the elements, here ][  ][ displayed in their most terrific
 guise.  Still, as I ascended hi ][ gher, ][  ][ the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. ][  ][ Ruined 
castles hanging on the precipices of ][  piny mountains, the ][  ][ impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping fo
rth from ][  ][ among the trees formed a ][  scene of singular beauty.  But it was ][  ][ augmented and rendered sublime by the 
mighty Alps, whose white and ][  ][ shining  ][ pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another ][  ][ earth, the 
habitations of another race of beings. ][  ][ I  ][ passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river ][  ][ for
ms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the moun ][ tain that ][  ][ overhangs it.  Soon after, I entered the valley of Cham
ounix.  This ][  ][ valley is more wonderful and sublime ][ , but not so beautiful and ][  ][ picturesque as that of Servox, thr
ough which I had just passed.  The ][  ][ high and snowy mou ][ ntains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no ][  ][ more r
uined castles and fertile fields.  Immense glaciers approached ] ][ [  ][ the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling 
avalanche and ][  ][ marked the smoke of its passage.  Mont Blanc, t ][ he supreme and ][  ][ magnificent Mont Blanc, raised its
elf from the surrounding aiguilles, ][  ][ and its tremendous dome overl ][ ooked the valley. ][  ][ A tingling long-lost sense 
of pleasure often came across me during this ][  ][ journey.  Some turn in t ][ he road, some new object suddenly perceived and 
][  ][ recognized, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the ][  ][  ][ lighthearted gaiety of boyhood.  The ver
y winds whispered in soothing ][  ][ accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no mo ][ re.  Then again the ][  ][ kindly influe
nce ceased to act--I found myself fettered again to grief ][  ][ and indulging in all th ][ e misery of reflection.  Then I spur
red on my ][  ][ animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, ][  ] ][ [ myself--or, in a more desperat
e fashion, I alighted and threw myself on ][  ][ the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.  ][ ][  ][ At length I arrived a
t the village of Chamounix.  Exhaustion succeeded ][  ][ to the extreme fatigue both of body and of  ][ mind which I had endured
. ][  ][ For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid ][  ][ lightnings that p ][ layed above Mont Bla
nc and listening to the rushing of ][  ][ the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.  The same lulling s ][ ounds ][  ][ act
ed as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head ][  ][ upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I f ][ elt it as it
 came and blessed ][  ][ the giver of oblivion. ][  ][ Chapter 10 ][  ][ I spent the following day roaming through t ][ he valle
y.  I stood beside ][  ][ the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that ][  ][ with slow pace is ][  adv
ancing down from the summit of the hills to ][  ][ barricade the valley.  The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before ][  ][ 
 ][ me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were ][  ][ scattered around; and the solemn silence of t
 ][ his glorious ][  ][ presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling ][  ][ waves or the fall of some vas
t fr ][ agment, the thunder sound of the ][  ][ avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the ][  ][ accum
ulated i ][ ce, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, ][  ][ was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been b
ut a playthi ][ ng in ][  ][ their hands.  These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the ][  ][ greatest consolation that
 I was capable o ][ f receiving.  They elevated me ][  ][ from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my ][
  ][ grief, they sub ][ dued and tranquillized it.  In some degree, also, they ][  ][ diverted my mind from the thoughts over wh
ich it had brooded for t ][ he ][  ][ last month.  I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, ][  ][ waited on and min
istered to by the assemblanc ][ e of grand shapes which I ][  ][ had contemplated during the day.  They congregated round me; th
e ][  ][ unstained snowy mountai ][ n-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, ][  ][ and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, so
aring amidst the clouds--they all ][ ][   ][ gathered round me and bade me be at peace. ][  ][ Where had they fled when the next
 morning I awoke?  All of ][  ][ soul-in ][ spiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every ][  ][ thought.  The ra
in was pouring in torrents, and thick mists  ][ hid the ][  ][ summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of tho
se ][  ][ mighty friends.  Still I would penetra ][ te their misty veil and seek them ][  ][ in their cloudy retreats.  What wer
e rain and storm to me?  My mule was ][  ][ brought  ][ to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of ][  ][ Montanvert
.  I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendo ][ us ][  ][ and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I f
irst saw it. ][  ][ It had then filled me with a sublime ecs ][ tasy that gave wings to the ][  ][ soul and allowed it to soar f
rom the obscure world to light and joy. ][  ][ The sight of the  ][ awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the ][  ][ ef
fect of solemnizing my mind and causing me to forget the passing ][  ][  ][ cares of life.  I determined to go without a guide, 
for I was well ][  ][ acquainted with the path, and the presence of anot ][ her would destroy the ][  ][ solitary grandeur of th
e scene. ][  ][ The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continua ][ l and short ][  ][ windings, which enable you to
 surmount the perpendicularity of the ][  ][ mountain.  It is a scene terrifical ][ ly desolate.  In a thousand spots ][  ][ the
 traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie ][  ][ broken and  ][ strewed on the ground, some entirely des
troyed, others bent, ][  ][ leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transverse ][ ly upon ][  ][ other trees.  The pat
h, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines ][  ][ of snow, down which stones continu ][ ally roll from above; one of the
m is ][  ][ particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking ][  ][ in a lo ][ ud voice, produces a concuss
ion of air sufficient to draw ][  ][ destruction upon the head of the speaker.  The pines are not ta ][ ll or ][  ][ luxuriant, 
but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene. ][  ][ I looked on the valley beneath; vast ][  mists were rising f
rom the rivers ][  ][ which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite ][  ][ mountains ][ , whose summits 
were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain ][  ][ poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impressio ][ n I ][  ][ r
eceived from the objects around me.  Alas!  Why does man boast of ][  ][ sensibilities superior to those apparent in ][  the bru
te; it only renders ][  ][ them more necessary beings.  If our impulses were confined to hunger, ][  ][ thirst, and desi ][ re, 
we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by ][  ][ every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may  ][ 
][  ][ convey to us. ][  ][   We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep. ][  ][    We rise; one wand'ring thought pollutes the 
 ][ day. ][  ][   We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep, ][  ][    Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away; ][  ][   It i
s th ][ e same:  for, be it joy or sorrow, ][  ][    The path of its departure still is free. ][  ][   Man's yesterday may ne'er
 be like ][  his morrow; ][  ][    Nought may endure but mutability! ][  ][ It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the 
ascent.  For ][  some ][  ][ time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.  A mist covered ][  ][ both that and the su
rrounding mounta ][ ins.  Presently a breeze dissipated ][  ][ the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.  The surface is very
 ][  ][ uneven, risi ][ ng like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and ][  ][ interspersed by rifts that sink deep.  T
he field of ice is almos ][ t a ][  ][ league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.  The ][  ][ opposite mounta
in is a bare perpendicular r ][ ock.  From the side where I ][  ][ now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of
 a league; ][  ][ and above it r ][ ose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.  I remained in a recess ][  ][ of the rock, gazing on this
 wonderful and stupendous scene.  Th ][ e sea, ][  ][ or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, ][  
][ whose aerial summits hung over its re ][ cesses.  Their icy and glittering ][  ][ peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds
.  My heart, which was ][  ][ before sorrowf ][ ul, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed, ][  ][ "Wandering spirits,
 if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your na ][ rrow ][  ][ beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your compani
on, ][  ][ away from the joys of life." ][  ][ As I  ][ said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, ][  ]
[ advancing towards me with superhuman speed.  He bounde ][ d over the ][  ][ crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with
 caution; his ][  ][ stature, also, as he approached, seemed ][  to exceed that of man.  I was ][  ][ troubled; a mist came over
 my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, ][  ][ but I was quic ][ kly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.  I ][  ][ pe
rceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!) ] ][ [  ][ that it was the wretch whom I had created.  I trem
bled with rage and ][  ][ horror, resolving to wait his approach and the ][ n close with him in ][  ][ mortal combat.  He approa
ched; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, ][  ][ combined with disdain a ][ nd malignity, while its unearthly ugliness ][  ]
[ rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.  But I scarcely ][  ][ observe ][ d this; rage and hatred had at first deprive
d me of utterance, ][  ][ and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressiv ][ e of furious ][  ][ detestation and cont
empt. ][  ][ "Devil," I exclaimed, "do you dare approach me?  And do not you fear ][  ][ ][  the fierce vengeance of my arm wrea
ked on your miserable head?  Begone, ][  ][ vile insect!  Or rather, stay, that I may trampl ][ e you to dust!  And, ][  ][ oh! 
 That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, ][  ][ restore those victims who ][ m you have so diabolically m
urdered!" ][  ][ "I expected this reception," said the daemon.  "All men hate the ][  ][ wretched; h ][ ow, then, must I be hate
d, who am miserable beyond all ][  ][ living things!  Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy crea ][ ture, ][  ][ to whom
 thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of ][  ][ one of us.  You purpose to kill me.  H ][ ow dare you spor
t thus with life? ][  ][ Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of ][  ][ mankind. ][   If you wil
l comply with my conditions, I will leave them and ][  ][ you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of de ][ ath, unt
il it ][  ][ be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends." ][  ][ "Abhorred monster!  Fiend that thou art!  The ][  tor
tures of hell are too ][  ][ mild a vengeance for thy crimes.  Wretched devil!  You reproach me with ][  ][ your creation, c ][ 
ome on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I ][  ][ so negligently bestowed." ][  ][ My rage was without bounds; I spra
 ][ ng on him, impelled by all the ][  ][ feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another. ][  ][ He easily el
uded ][  me and said, ][  ][ "Be calm!  I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred ][  ][ on my devoted head. 
 Have I  ][ not suffered enough, that you seek to ][  ][ increase my misery?  Life, although it may only be an accumulation of ]
[  ][ anguis ][ h, is dear to me, and I will defend it.  Remember, thou hast made ][  ][ me more powerful than thyself; my heigh
t is superior to ][  thine, my ][  ][ joints more supple.  But I will not be tempted to set myself in ][  ][ opposition to thee.
  I am thy creature, ][  and I will be even mild and ][  ][ docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy par
t, ][  ][ the which thou ][  owest me.  Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every ][  ][ other and trample upon me alone, to w
hom thy justice, and even th ][ y ][  ][ clemency and affection, is most due.  Remember that I am thy creature; ][  ][ I ought t
o be thy Adam, but I am rather t ][ he fallen angel, whom thou ][  ][ drivest from joy for no misdeed.  Everywhere I see bliss, 
from which I ][  ][ alone am irrevoc ][ ably excluded.  I was benevolent and good; misery made ][  ][ me a fiend.  Make me happy
, and I shall again be virtuous." ][  ][ ][  "Begone!  I will not hear you.  There can be no community between you ][  ][ and me
; we are enemies.  Begone, or let us try our ][  strength in a fight, ][  ][ in which one must fall." ][  ][ "How can I move the
e?  Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a ][   ][ ][ favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and ][  ][ co
mpassion?  Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolen ][ t; my soul glowed ][  ][ with love and humanity; but am I not alone, mis
erably alone?  You, my ][  ][ creator, abhor me; what ho ][ pe can I gather from your fellow creatures, ][  ][ who owe me nothin
g?  They spurn and hate me.  The desert mountains and ][  ][ ][  dreary glaciers are my refuge.  I have wandered here many days;
 the ][  ][ caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelli ][ ng to me, and the ][  ][ only one which man does not grudge.
  These bleak skies I hail, for they ][  ][ are kinder to me than yo ][ ur fellow beings.  If the multitude of mankind ][  ][ kn
ew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for ][   ][ ][ my destruction.  Shall I not then hate them who a
bhor me?  I will keep ][  ][ no terms with my enemies.  I am miserable, and  ][ they shall share my ][  ][ wretchedness.  Yet it
 is in your power to recompense me, and deliver ][  ][ them from an evil which i ][ t only remains for you to make so great, tha
t ][  ][ not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be ][  ][ swal ][ lowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. 
 Let your compassion be ][  ][ moved, and do not disdain me.  Listen to my tale; when yo ][ u have heard ][  ][ that, abandon or
 commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve. ][  ][ But hear me.  The guilty are allo ][ wed, by human laws, bloody as th
ey ][  ][ are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.  Listen ][  ][ to me, Fr ][ ankenstein.  You accuse me o
f murder, and yet you would, with ][  ][ a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.  Oh, pra ][ ise the ][  ][ eternal j
ustice of man!  Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, ][  ][ and then, if you can, and if you wil ][ l, destroy the work 
of your hands." ][  ][ "Why do you call to my remembrance," I rejoined, "circumstances of ][  ][ which I shu ][ dder to reflect,
 that I have been the miserable origin and ][  ][ author?  Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first ][  saw ][  ][ 
light!  Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you! ][  ][ You have made me wretched beyond expre ][ ssion.  
You have left me no power ][  ][ to consider whether I am just to you or not.  Begone!  Relieve me from ][  ][ the sight ][  of 
your detested form." ][  ][ "Thus I relieve thee, my creator," he said, and placed his hated hands ][  ][ before my eyes, wh ][ 
ich I flung from me with violence; "thus I take from ][  ][ thee a sight which you abhor.  Still thou canst listen to me and gra
 ][ nt ][  ][ me thy compassion.  By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this ][  ][ from you.  Hear my tale; it is long
 and ][  strange, and the temperature of ][  ][ this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon ][  ][ t
he mount ][ ain.  The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends ][  ][ to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and 
illuminate a ][ nother ][  ][ world, you will have heard my story and can decide.  On you it rests, ][  ][ whether I quit foreve
r the neighbourh ][ ood of man and lead a harmless ][  ][ life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of
 ][  ][ your own spe ][ edy ruin." ][  ][ As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.  My heart ][  ][ was full, 
and I did not answer him ][ , but as I proceeded, I weighed the ][  ][ various arguments that he had used and determined at leas
t to listen to ][  ][ his ta ][ le.  I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my ][  ][ resolution.  I had hith
erto supposed him to be the murd ][ erer of my ][  ][ brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion. ][
  ][ For the first time, also, I fel ][ t what the duties of a creator towards ][  ][ his creature were, and that I ought to ren
der him happy before I ][  ][ complained ][  of his wickedness.  These motives urged me to comply with ][  ][ his demand.  We cr
ossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the o ][ pposite ][  ][ rock.  The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we 
][  ][ entered the hut, the fiend with an air of ][  exultation, I with a heavy ][  ][ heart and depressed spirits.  But I conse
nted to listen, and seating ][  ][ myself by the fir ][ e which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began ][  ][ his tale. 
][  ][ Chapter 11 ][  ][ "It is with considerable diffic ][ ulty that I remember the original era of ][  ][ my being; all the ev
ents of that period appear confused and indistinct. ][  ][ A ][  strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, 
heard, ][  ][ and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a  ][ long time before I ][  ][ learned to distinguish between the
 operations of my various senses.  By ][  ][ degrees, I remember, a  ][ stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I ][  ][ 
was obliged to shut my eyes.  Darkness then came over me and troubled ][ ][   ][ me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening
 my eyes, as I now ][  ][ suppose, the light poured in upon me again.  I wal ][ ked and, I believe, ][  ][ descended, but I pres
ently found a great alteration in my sensations. ][  ][ Before, dark and opaque  ][ bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my ]
[  ][ touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with ][  ][ ][  no obstacles which I could not either s
urmount or avoid.  The light ][  ][ became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat  ][ wearying me as I ][  ][ walked, I so
ught a place where I could receive shade.  This was the ][  ][ forest near Ingolstadt; and h ][ ere I lay by the side of a brook
 resting ][  ][ from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.  This ][  ][ rouse ][ d me from my nearly dormant 
state, and I ate some berries which I ][  ][ found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.  I s ][ laked my thirst ][  ][ a
t the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep. ][  ][ "It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold a ][ lso, and half fright
ened, as it ][  ][ were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.  Before I had quitted ][  ][ your apartm ][ ent, on a sensat
ion of cold, I had covered myself with some ][  ][ clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the de ][ ws of ][  ][
 night.  I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could ][  ][ distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain i ][ nvade me
 on all sides, I sat ][  ][ down and wept. ][  ][ "Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of ][  ][ 
 ][ pleasure.  I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the ][  ][ trees.  [The moon]  I gazed with a kind of  ][ 
wonder.  It moved slowly, ][  ][ but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries. ][  ][ I was still cold 
 ][ when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with ][  ][ which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.  No dist
inct ][  ][  ][ ideas occupied my mind; all was confused.  I felt light, and hunger, ][  ][ and thirst, and darkness; innumerabl
e sounds ][  rang in my ears, and on ][  ][ all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could ][  ][ distinguish
 was the bri ][ ght moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with ][  ][ pleasure. ][  ][ "Several changes of day and night passed, and
 the orb of nigh ][ t had ][  ][ greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each ][  ][ other.  I graduall
y saw plainly the cl ][ ear stream that supplied me with ][  ][ drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.  I was de
lighted ][  ][ when I fi ][ rst discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ][  ][ ears, proceeded from the throats
 of the little winged animal ][ s who had ][  ][ often intercepted the light from my eyes.  I began also to observe, ][  ][ with
 greater accuracy, the forms tha ][ t surrounded me and to perceive the ][  ][ boundaries of the radiant roof of light which can
opied me.  Sometimes I ][  ][ tried  ][ to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable. ][  ][ Sometimes I wished to 
express my sensations in my own mode, bu ][ t the ][  ][ uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into 
][  ][ silence again. ][  ][ "The moon had d ][ isappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened ][  ][ form, showed itself
, while I still remained in the forest.  My ][   ][ ][ sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every ]
[  ][ day additional ideas.  My eyes became accustom ][ ed to the light and to ][  ][ perceive objects in their right forms; I d
istinguished the insect from ][  ][ the herb, and by deg ][ rees, one herb from another.  I found that the ][  ][ sparrow uttere
d none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and ][ ][   ][ thrush were sweet and enticing. ][  ][ "One day, when I was
 oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been ][  ][ left by ][  some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at th
e ][  ][ warmth I experienced from it.  In my joy I thrust my hand i ][ nto the live ][  ][ embers, but quickly drew it out agai
n with a cry of pain.  How strange, ][  ][ I thought, that the same caus ][ e should produce such opposite effects!  I ][  ][ ex
amined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be ][  ][ compos ][ ed of wood.  I quickly collected some branches, 
but they were wet ][  ][ and would not burn.  I was pained at this and sat still ][  watching the ][  ][ operation of the fire. 
 The wet wood which I had placed near the heat ][  ][ dried and itself became inflam ][ ed.  I reflected on this, and by touchin
g ][  ][ the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in ][  ][ collec ][ ting a great quantity of wood, that 
I might dry it and have a ][  ][ plentiful supply of fire.  When night came on and brought s ][ leep with ][  ][ it, I was in th
e greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.  I ][  ][ covered it carefully with dry woo ][ d and leaves and placed wet 
branches ][  ][ upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank ][  ][ into slee ][ p. ][  ][ "It was mornin
g when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. ][  ][ I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quic ][ kly fanned it into a
 flame.  I ][  ][ observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the ][  ][ embers when th ][ ey were nearly e
xtinguished.  When night came again I ][  ][ found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and  ][ that ][  ][ 
the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found ][  ][ some of the offals that the travellers ][  had lef
t had been roasted, and ][  ][ tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.  I ][  ][ tried, the ][ refo
re, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on ][  ][ the live embers.  I found that the berries were spoiled by thi ][ 
s ][  ][ operation, and the nuts and roots much improved. ][  ][ "Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day 
 ][ ][  ][ searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When ][  ][ I found this, I resolved to quit the p
lace ][  that I had hitherto ][  ][ inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be ][  ][ more easily sat
isfied.  ][  In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the ][  ][ loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and kne
w not how ][ ][   ][ to reproduce it.  I gave several hours to the serious consideration of ][  ][ this difficulty, but I was ob
liged to relinqu ][ ish all attempt to supply ][  ][ it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood ][  ][ tow
ards the setting sun ][ .  I passed three days in these rambles and at ][  ][ length discovered the open country.  A great fall 
of snow had taken ][  ][ ][  place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the ][  ][ appearance was discons
olate, and I found my feet c ][ hilled by the cold ][  ][ damp substance that covered the ground. ][  ][ "It was about seven in 
the morning, and I longed to obt ][ ain food and ][  ][ shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which ][
  ][ had doubtless been built for th ][ e convenience of some shepherd.  This ][  ][ was a new sight to me, and I examined the s
tructure with great ][  ][ curiosity.  F ][ inding the door open, I entered.  An old man sat in it, ][  ][ near a fire, over whi
ch he was preparing his breakfast.  He turne ][ d on ][  ][ hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting th
e ][  ][ hut, ran across the fields with a speed ][  of which his debilitated form ][  ][ hardly appeared capable.  His appearan
ce, different from any I had ever ][  ][ before seen ][ , and his flight somewhat surprised me.  But I was enchanted ][  ][ by t
he appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could n ][ ot ][  ][ penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then
 as exquisite ][  ][ and divine a retreat as Pandemonium app ][ eared to the demons of hell ][  ][ after their sufferings in the
 lake of fire.  I greedily devoured the ][  ][ remnants of the s ][ hepherd's breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, ][  ]
[ milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.  Then, overco ][ me by ][  ][ fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fe
ll asleep. ][  ][ "It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth o ][ f the sun, which ][  ][ shone brightly on the white 
ground, I determined to recommence my ][  ][ travels; and, depositing the re ][ mains of the peasant's breakfast in a ][  ][ wal
let I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until ][  ][ at su ][ nset I arrived at a village.  How miraculous
 did this appear!  The ][  ][ huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged  ][ my admiration by ][  ][ turns.  The vege
tables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw ][  ][ placed at the windows of so ][ me of the cottages, allured my appet
ite. One ][  ][ of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within ][  ] ][ [ the door before the children s
hrieked, and one of the women fainted. ][  ][ The whole village was roused; some fled, some atta ][ cked me, until, ][  ][ griev
ously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I ][  ][ escaped to the open countr ][ y and fearfully took ref
uge in a low hovel, ][  ][ quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had ][  ][ b ][ eheld in the village
.  This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat ][  ][ and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly b ][ ought experience
, I ][  ][ dared not enter it.  My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so ][  ][ low that I could with  ][ difficulty s
it upright in it.  No wood, however, ][  ][ was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and ][  ][  ][ alth
ough the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an ][  ][ agreeable asylum from the snow and rain. ][  ][ "He ][ re, 
then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, ][  ][ however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, a ][ 
nd still more ][  ][ from the barbarity of man.  As soon as morning dawned I crept from my ][  ][ kennel, that I might view the 
 ][ adjacent cottage and discover if I could ][  ][ remain in the habitation I had found.  It was situated against the back ][  
][ o ][ f the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig ][  ][ sty and a clear pool of water.  One part wa
s open,  ][ and by that I had ][  ][ crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived ][  ][ with stones 
and wood, ye ][ t in such a manner that I might move them on ][  ][ occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through t
he sty, and ][   ][ ][ that was sufficient for me. ][  ][ "Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I 
][  ][ retired, for  ][ I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered ][  ][ too well my treatment the night before 
to trust myself in his p ][ ower.  I ][  ][ had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf ][  ][ of coar
se bread, which I purloined, ][  and a cup with which I could drink ][  ][ more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water
 which flowed by ][  ][ my retre ][ at.  The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept ][  ][ perfectly dry, and by its vic
inity to the chimney of the cottage  ][ it was ][  ][ tolerably warm. ][  ][ "Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this 
hovel until ][  ][ something should occu ][ r which might alter my determination.  It was ][  ][ indeed a paradise compared to t
he bleak forest, my former residence, ][  ][ ][  the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.  I ate my breakfast with ][  ][ ple
asure and was about to remove a plank to procure ][  myself a little ][  ][ water when I heard a step, and looking through a sma
ll chink, I beheld ][  ][ a young creature, with a p ][ ail on her head, passing before my hovel. The ][  ][ girl was young and 
of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found ][   ][ ][ cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.  Yet she was meanly dress
ed, a ][  ][ coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being  ][ her only garb; her fair ][  ][ hair was plaited but not adorned:
  she looked patient yet sad.  I lost ][  ][ sight of her, and i ][ n about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing ][  ][ the
 pail, which was now partly filled with milk.  As she walked along,  ][ ][  ][ seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man m
et her, whose ][  ][ countenance expressed a deeper despondence.  Utteri ][ ng a few sounds with ][  ][ an air of melancholy, he
 took the pail from her head and bore it to the ][  ][ cottage himself.  She ][  followed, and they disappeared.  Presently I sa
w ][  ][ the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field ][  ] ][ [ behind the cottage; and the girl was also 
busied, sometimes in the ][  ][ house and sometimes in the yard. ][  ][ "On examinin ][ g my dwelling, I found that one of the w
indows of the ][  ][ cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been  ][ ][  ][ filled up with wood. In one o
f these was a small and almost ][  ][ imperceptible chink through which the eye could just p ][ enetrate. ][  ][ Through this cr
evice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean ][  ][ but very bare of furniture. In one  ][ corner, near a small fire, s
at an ][  ][ old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The ][  ][ young gir ][ l was occupied in arrang
ing the cottage; but presently she ][  ][ took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and  ][ she sat ][  ][ down 
beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play ][  ][ and to produce sounds sweeter than th ][ e voice of the t
hrush or the ][  ][ nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had ][  ][ never beheld augh ][ t beautiful 
before. The silver hair and benevolent ][  ][ countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle ][ ][   ][ man
ners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air ][  ][ which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of hi ][ s am
iable companion, of ][  ][ which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then ][  ][ pronounced a few sound ][ 
s, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt ][  ][ at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection 
 ][ ][  ][ that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were ][  ][ a mixture of pain and pleasure, such a
s I  ][ had never before experienced, ][  ][ either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the ][  ][ window, 
unable t ][ o bear these emotions. ][  ][ "Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a ][  ][ load of woo
d.  The girl ][  met him at the door, helped to relieve him of ][  ][ his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, 
placed it on ][  ][  ][ the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, ][  ][ and he showed her a large
 loaf and a piece of ][  cheese.  She seemed ][  ][ pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she ][  ][
 placed in water, and th ][ en upon the fire.  She afterwards continued her ][  ][ work, whilst the young man went into the gard
en and appeared busily ][  ] ][ [ employed in digging and pulling up roots.  After he had been employed ][  ][ thus about an hou
r, the young woman joined him an ][ d they entered the ][  ][ cottage together. ][  ][ "The old man had, in the meantime, been p
ensive, but on the appearance ][  ][ ][  of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to ][  ][ eat.  The
 meal was quickly dispatched.  The young ][  woman was again ][  ][ occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before
 the ][  ][ cottage in the sun for a few min ][ utes, leaning on the arm of the youth. ][  ][ Nothing could exceed in beauty the
 contrast between these two excellent ][  ][ cre ][ atures.  One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming ][  ][ wit
h benevolence and love; the younger was slight and g ][ raceful in his ][  ][ figure, and his features were moulded with the fin
est symmetry, yet his ][  ][ eyes and attitude expressed ][  the utmost sadness and despondency.  The ][  ][ old man returned to
 the cottage, and the youth, with tools different ][  ][ fro ][ m those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across th
e ][  ][ fields. ][  ][ "Night quickly shut in, but to my extrem ][ e wonder, I found that the ][  ][ cottagers had a means of p
rolonging light by the use of tapers, and was ][  ][ delighted to fi ][ nd that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the
 ][  ][ pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.  In the  ][ evening ][  ][ the young girl and her companion were
 employed in various occupations ][  ][ which I did not understand; and the  ][ old man again took up the ][  ][ instrument whic
h produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in ][  ][ the morning.  So so ][ on as he had finished, the youth began, not 
to play, ][  ][ but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the ][  ][  ][ harmony of the old man's instrum
ent nor the songs of the birds; I since ][  ][ found that he read aloud, but at that tim ][ e I knew nothing of the ][  ][ scien
ce of words or letters. ][  ][ "The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time ][ , ][  ][ extinguished their ligh
ts and retired, as I conjectured, to rest." ][  ][ Chapter 12 ][  ][ "I lay on my straw, but I c ][ ould not sleep.  I thought o
f the ][  ][ occurrences of the day.  What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners ][  ][ of these  ][ people, and I longed to 
join them, but dared not.  I ][  ][ remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before fr ][ om ][  ][ the barbar
ous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I ][  ][ might hereafter think it right to pursue, t ][ hat for the pres
ent I would ][  ][ remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the ][  ][ motives which in ][ fluenced the
ir actions. ][  ][ "The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.  The young woman ][  ][ arranged the cottag ][ e and pr
epared the food, and the youth departed ][  ][ after the first meal. ][  ][ "This day was passed in the same routine as  ][ that
 which preceded it. ][  ][ The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in ][  ][ various laborious occu ][ 
pations within.  The old man, whom I soon ][  ][ perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or ][  ][ i
 ][ n contemplation.  Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the ][  ][ younger cottagers exhibited towards their vener
able ][  companion.  They ][  ][ performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with ][  ][ gentleness, and he 
rewarded ][  them by his benevolent smiles. ][  ][ "They were not entirely happy.  The young man and his companion often ][  ][ 
went apart a ][ nd appeared to weep.  I saw no cause for their unhappiness, ][  ][ but I was deeply affected by it.  If such lov
ely creatures we ][ re ][  ][ miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, ][  ][ should be wretched.
  Yet why were these ][  gentle beings unhappy?  They ][  ][ possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every
 ][  ][ luxury; they had ][  a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands ][  ][ when hungry; they were dressed in excell
ent clothes; and, still more ][ , ][  ][ they enjoyed one another's company and speech, interchanging each day ][  ][ looks of a
ffection and kindness.  What did ][  their tears imply?  Did they ][  ][ really express pain?  I was at first unable to solve th
ese questions, ][  ][ but perpetual  ][ attention and time explained to me many appearances which ][  ][ were at first enigmatic
. ][  ][ "A considerable period elapsed  ][ before I discovered one of the causes of ][  ][ the uneasiness of this amiable famil
y:  it was poverty, and they ][  ][ suffered ][  that evil in a very distressing degree.  Their nourishment ][  ][ consisted ent
irely of the vegetables of their garden and the  ][ milk of ][  ][ one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its m
asters ][  ][ could scarcely procure food to support ][  it.  They often, I believe, ][  ][ suffered the pangs of hunger very po
ignantly, especially the two ][  ][ younger cottagers, f ][ or several times they placed food before the old ][  ][ man when the
y reserved none for themselves. ][  ][ "This trait of kindne ][ ss moved me sensibly.  I had been accustomed, ][  ][ during the 
night, to steal a part of their store for my own ][  ][ consumpt ][ ion, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on
 ][  ][ the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries ][ , nuts, and ][  ][ roots which I gathered from a neighbo
uring wood. ][  ][ "I discovered also another means through which I was  ][ enabled to assist ][  ][ their labours.  I found tha
t the youth spent a great part of each day ][  ][ in collecting wood for the ][  family fire, and during the night I often ][  ]
[ took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home ][  ][ ][  firing sufficient for the consumption of se
veral days. ][  ][ "I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, whe ][ n she ][  ][ opened the door in the morn
ing, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a ][  ][ great pile of wood on the outside.   ][ She uttered some words in a loud ][ 
 ][ voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise.  I ][  ][ observed, with p ][ leasure, that he did not go to t
he forest that day, but ][  ][ spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden. ][  ][  ][ "By degrees I made a dis
covery of still greater moment.  I found that ][  ][ these people possessed a method of communicatin ][ g their experience and ]
[  ][ feelings to one another by articulate sounds.  I perceived that the ][  ][ words they spoke someti ][ mes produced pleasur
e or pain, smiles or ][  ][ sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers.  This was indeed ][  ][ a ][  godlike science
, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. ][  ][ But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this ][  purpose.  T
heir ][  ][ pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any ][  ][ apparent connection with visi ][ ble obje
cts, I was unable to discover any ][  ][ clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference.  By great ][  ][  ][ appl
ication, however, and after having remained during the space of ][  ][ several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discov ][ 
ered the names ][  ][ that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I ][  ][ learned and applied the words,
 ][  'fire,' 'milk,' 'bread,' and 'wood.'  I ][  ][ learned also the names of the cottagers themselves.  The youth and his ][  ]
[ co ][ mpanion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, ][  ][ which was 'father.' The girl was called 'si
ster' or ][  'Agatha,' and the ][  ][ youth 'Felix,' 'brother,' or 'son.'  I cannot describe the delight I ][  ][ felt when I le
arned the id ][ eas appropriated to each of these sounds and ][  ][ was able to pronounce them.  I distinguished several other w
ords ][  ][ with ][ out being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as 'good,' ][  ][ 'dearest,' 'unhappy.' ][  ][ "I sp
ent the winter in th ][ is manner.  The gentle manners and beauty of ][  ][ the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they
 were unhappy, I ][  ][  ][ felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys.  I saw ][  ][ few human beings besi
des them, and if any other h ][ appened to enter the ][  ][ cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the ]
[  ][ superior accomplishments o ][ f my friends.  The old man, I could perceive, ][  ][ often endeavoured to encourage his chil
dren, as sometimes I found that ][   ][ ][ he called them, to cast off their melancholy.  He would talk in a ][  ][ cheerful acc
ent, with an expression of goodness that ][  bestowed pleasure ][  ][ even upon me.  Agatha listened with respect, her eyes some
times filled ][  ][ with tears, which she en ][ deavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I ][  ][ generally found that her counte
nance and tone were more cheerful after ][  ][ h ][ aving listened to the exhortations of her father.  It was not thus ][  ][ wi
th Felix.  He was always the saddest of the group, a ][ nd even to my ][  ][ unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered mo
re deeply than his ][  ][ friends.  But if his countenan ][ ce was more sorrowful, his voice was more ][  ][ cheerful than that 
of his sister, especially when he addressed the old ][  ][ m ][ an. ][  ][ "I could mention innumerable instances which, althoug
h slight, marked ][  ][ the dispositions of these amiable cottag ][ ers.  In the midst of poverty ][  ][ and want, Felix carried
 with pleasure to his sister the first little ][  ][ white flower th ][ at peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.  Early in ]
[  ][ the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that ] ][ [  ][ obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew wa
ter from the well, and ][  ][ brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to  ][ his perpetual ][  ][ astonishment, he found his 
store always replenished by an invisible ][  ][ hand.  In the day, I believe, he ][  worked sometimes for a neighbouring ][  ][ 
farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, ][  ][ yet brou ][ ght no wood with him.  At other times he
 worked in the garden, ][  ][ but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he rea ][ d to the old ][  ][ man and Agatha. 
][  ][ "This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I ][  ][ discovered t ][ hat he uttered many of the same 
sounds when he read as when ][  ][ he talked.  I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the pa ][ per signs ][  ][ for speech 
which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend ][  ][ these also; but how was that possibl ][ e when I did not even un
derstand ][  ][ the sounds for which they stood as signs?  I improved, however, ][  ][ sensibly in this  ][ science, but not suf
ficiently to follow up any kind of ][  ][ conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, f ][ or I ][  ][ easi
ly perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to ][  ][ the cottagers, I ought not to make the ][  attempt unt
il I had first become ][  ][ master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them ][  ][ overlook  ][ the defo
rmity of my figure, for with this also the contrast ][  ][ perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted. ][   ][ ][ "
I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers--their grace, beauty, ][  ][ and delicate complexions; but how was I terrifi ][ 
ed when I viewed myself ][  ][ in a transparent pool!  At first I started back, unable to believe that ][  ][ it was indeed I wh
 ][ o was reflected in the mirror; and when I became ][  ][ fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was ]
[  ] ][ [ filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. ][  ][ Alas!  I did not yet entirely know the f
atal eff ][ ects of this miserable ][  ][ deformity. ][  ][ "As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow ][  
][ vanished, ][  and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.  From this ][  ][ time Felix was more employed, and the heart-
moving indicatio ][ ns of ][  ][ impending famine disappeared.  Their food, as I afterwards found, was ][  ][ coarse, but it was
 wholesome; and they ][  procured a sufficiency of it. ][  ][ Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they ][
  ][ dressed; and these  ][ signs of comfort increased daily as the season ][  ][ advanced. ][  ][ "The old man, leaning on his 
son, walked each day at noon ][ , when it did ][  ][ not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its ][  ][
 waters.  This frequently took p ][ lace, but a high wind quickly dried the ][  ][ earth, and the season became far more pleasan
t than it had been. ][  ][ "My mode  ][ of life in my hovel was uniform.  During the morning I ][  ][ attended the motions of th
e cottagers, and when they were disperse ][ d in ][  ][ various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in ][  
][ observing my friends.  When they had reti ][ red to rest, if there was any ][  ][ moon or the night was star-light, I went in
to the woods and collected ][  ][ my own food an ][ d fuel for the cottage.  When I returned, as often as it ][  ][ was necessar
y, I cleared their path from the snow and performed  ][ those ][  ][ offices that I had seen done by Felix.  I afterwards found 
that these ][  ][ labours, performed by an invisible han ][ d, greatly astonished them; and ][  ][ once or twice I heard them, o
n these occasions, utter the words 'good ][  ][ spirit,' 'wo ][ nderful'; but I did not then understand the signification ][  ][
 of these terms. ][  ][ "My thoughts now became more active, and ][  I longed to discover the ][  ][ motives and feelings of the
se lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to ][  ][ know why Felix appe ][ ared so miserable and Agatha so sad.  I thought ][  ][ (
foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to ][ ][   ][ these deserving people.  When I slept or was ab
sent, the forms of the ][  ][ venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and ][  the excellent Felix ][  ][ flitted before me.  
I looked upon them as superior beings who would be ][  ][ the arbiters of my fut ][ ure destiny.  I formed in my imagination a ]
[  ][ thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of ][  ][  ][ me.  I imagined that they would be disgu
sted, until, by my gentle ][  ][ demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win th ][ eir favour and ][  ][ afterwards the
ir love. ][  ][ "These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to ][   ][ ][ the acquiring the art of lang
uage.  My organs were indeed harsh, but ][  ][ supple; and although my voice was very unlike the ][  soft music of their ][  ][ 
tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. ][  ][ It was as the ass and ][  the lap-dog; yet surely
 the gentle ass whose ][  ][ intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved ][   ][ ][ better treatment 
than blows and execration. ][  ][ "The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the ][   ][ ][ aspect of the
 earth.  Men who before this change seemed to have been ][  ][ hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employ ][ ed in variou
s arts of ][  ][ cultivation.  The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves ][  ][ began to bud forth on th ][ e trees.
  Happy, happy earth!  Fit habitation ][  ][ for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and ][  ][ unwhol ][ esom
e.  My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of ][  ][ nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present ][ 
 was tranquil, ][  ][ and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy." ][  ][ Chapter 13 ][  ][ "I now ha
 ][ sten to the more moving part of my story.  I shall relate ][  ][ events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I h
ad b ][ een, ][  ][ have made me what I am. ][  ][ "Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies ][  ][ cloudl
ess.  It ][  surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy ][  ][ should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and ver
dure.  My ][ ][   ][ senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and ][  ][ a thousand sights of beauty.
 ][  ][ "It was  ][ on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested ][  ][ from labour--the old man played on his gu
itar, and the childr ][ en ][  ][ listened to him--that I observed the countenance of Felix was ][  ][ melancholy beyond express
ion; he sighed frequentl ][ y, and once his father ][  ][ paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired 
][  ][ the cause of his son' ][ s sorrow.  Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and ][  ][ the old man was recommencing his music
 when someone tapped at the door ][ . ][  ][ "It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide. ][  ][ The la
dy was dressed in a dark suit and co ][ vered with a thick black ][  ][ veil.  Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger on
ly replied by ][  ][ pronouncing, in a s ][ weet accent, the name of Felix.  Her voice was ][  ][ musical but unlike that of eit
her of my friends.  On hearing this word, ][ ][   ][ Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her ][  
][ veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic b ][ eauty and expression.  Her ][  ][ hair of a shining raven black, and curious
ly braided; her eyes were ][  ][ dark, but gentle, a ][ lthough animated; her features of a regular ][  ][ proportion, and her c
omplexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with ][  ][ ][  a lovely pink. ][  ][ "Felix seemed ravished with delight when he s
aw her, every trait of ][  ][ sorrow vanished from his face, ][  and it instantly expressed a degree of ][  ][ ecstatic joy, of 
which I could hardly have believed it capable; his ][  ][ eyes s ][ parkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that mom
ent I ][  ][ thought him as beautiful as the stranger.  She appeared ][  affected by ][  ][ different feelings; wiping a few tea
rs from her lovely eyes, she held ][  ][ out her hand to Felix, who kiss ][ ed it rapturously and called her, as ][  ][ well as 
I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.  She did not appear to ][  ][ unders ][ tand him, but smiled.  He assisted her to dismou
nt, and ][  ][ dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.  Some ][  ] ][ [ conversation took place between him and hi
s father, and the young ][  ][ stranger knelt at the old man's feet and would have k ][ issed his hand, ][  ][ but he raised her
 and embraced her affectionately. ][  ][ "I soon perceived that although the stranger ut ][ tered articulate sounds ][  ][ and a
ppeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood ][  ][ by nor herself unde ][ rstood the cottagers.  They made
 many signs which I ][  ][ did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness ][  ][  ][ through the cottage, dis
pelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the ][  ][ morning mists.  Felix seemed peculiarly happy  ][ and with smiles of ][  ]
[ delight welcomed his Arabian.  Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed ][  ][ the hands of the lovely s ][ tranger, and pointin
g to her brother, made ][  ][ signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she ][  ][ ][  came.  Some hou
rs passed thus, while they, by their countenances, ][  ][ expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend ][ .  Presently
 I ][  ][ found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger ][  ][ repeated after them, that she wa ][ s endeav
ouring to learn their language; ][  ][ and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the ][  ][ same i ][ nstr
uctions to the same end.  The stranger learned about twenty ][  ][ words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were tho ][ 
se which I had ][  ][ before understood, but I profited by the others. ][  ][ "As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired 
 ][ early.  When they ][  ][ separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, 'Good night ][  ][ sweet Safie.'  He sat 
up m ][ uch longer, conversing with his father, and ][  ][ by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovel
y ][  ][ ][  guest was the subject of their conversation.  I ardently desired to ][  ][ understand them, and bent every faculty 
towards that ][  purpose, but found ][  ][ it utterly impossible. ][  ][ "The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after
 the usual ][  ] ][ [ occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the ][  ][ old man, and taking his gui
tar, played some air ][ s so entrancingly ][  ][ beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my ][  ][ eye
s.  She sang, and her vo ][ ice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or ][  ][ dying away like a nightingale of the woods. ][  ][ 
"When she had finished, she  ][ gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first ][  ][ declined it.  She played a simple air, and her vo
ice accompanied it in ][  ][ swe ][ et accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.  The old ][  ][ man appeared enr
aptured and said some words which Ag ][ atha endeavoured to ][  ][ explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express
 that she ][  ][ bestowed on him the gre ][ atest delight by her music. ][  ][ "The days now passed as peaceably as before, with
 the sole alteration ][  ][ that joy had tak ][ en place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. ][  ][ Safie was always g
ay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the  ][ ][  ][ knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend mo
st ][  ][ of the words uttered by my protectors. ][  ][  ][ "In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, an
d ][  ][ the green banks interspersed with innumerable f ][ lowers, sweet to the ][  ][ scent and the eyes, stars of pale radian
ce among the moonlight woods; ][  ][ the sun became warmer,  ][ the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal ][  ][ rambles were
 an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably ][   ][ ][ shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun
, for I never ][  ][ ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of mee ][ ting with the same ][  ][ treatment I had formerly endur
ed in the first village which I entered. ][  ][ "My days were spent in c ][ lose attention, that I might more speedily ][  ][ ma
ster the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than ][  ][  ][ the Arabian, who understood very little and conv
ersed in broken ][  ][ accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost e ][ very word that ][  ][ was spoken. ][  ][ "Wh
ile I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as ][  ][ it was tau ][ ght to the stranger, and this opened bef
ore me a wide field ][  ][ for wonder and delight. ][  ][ "The book from which Felix ins ][ tructed Safie was Volney's Ruins of 
][  ][ Empires.  I should not have understood the purport of this book had not ][  ][ Felix, ][  in reading it, given very minut
e explanations.  He had chosen ][  ][ this work, he said, because the declamatory style was fram ][ ed in ][  ][ imitation of th
e Eastern authors.  Through this work I obtained a ][  ][ cursory knowledge of history and a view of ][  the several empires at 
][  ][ present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, ][  ][ governments, and re ][ ligions of the diffe
rent nations of the earth.  I ][  ][ heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental ][  ][  ][ activity of 
the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early ][  ][ Romans--of their subsequent degenerating--of  ][ the decline 
of that mighty ][  ][ empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.  I heard of the discovery ][  ][ of the American ][  hemisph
ere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of ][  ][ its original inhabitants. ][  ][ "These wonderful narrations ins ][ pire
d me with strange feelings.  Was ][  ][ man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so ][  ][ vicious ][ 
 and base?  He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil ][  ][ principle and at another as all that can be conceived of nob
 ][ le and ][  ][ godlike.  To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour ][  ][ that can befall a sensitive being;
 to  ][ be base and vicious, as many on ][  ][ record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more ][  ][ abject
 than th ][ at of the blind mole or harmless worm.  For a long time I ][  ][ could not conceive how one man could go forth to mu
rder his fel ][ low, or ][  ][ even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of ][  ][ vice and bloodshed, 
my wonder ceased ][  and I turned away with disgust and ][  ][ loathing. ][  ][ "Every conversation of the cottagers now opened 
new wonders to me. ] ][ [  ][ While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the ][  ][ Arabian, the strange sys
tem of human society was ][  explained to me.  I ][  ][ heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid ][  ][ 
poverty, of rank, descent, a ][ nd noble blood. ][  ][ "The words induced me to turn towards myself.  I learned that the ][  ][ 
possessions most esteemed by you ][ r fellow creatures were high and ][  ][ unsullied descent united with riches.  A man might b
e respected with ][  ][ only one of  ][ these advantages, but without either he was considered, ][  ][ except in very rare insta
nces, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed  ][ to ][  ][ waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few!  And what was I? Of ][
  ][ my creation and creator I was absolutel ][ y ignorant, but I knew that I ][  ][ possessed no money, no friends, no kind of 
property.  I was, besides, ][  ][ endued with a  ][ figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even ][  ][ of the same n
ature as man.  I was more agile than they and could  ][ ][  ][ subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold w
ith ][  ][ less injury to my frame; my stature far excee ][ ded theirs.  When I looked ][  ][ around I saw and heard of none lik
e me.  Was I, then, a monster, a blot ][  ][ upon the earth, ][  from which all men fled and whom all men disowned? ][  ][ "I ca
nnot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted  ][ ][  ][ upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only incr
eased with ][  ][ knowledge.  Oh, that I had forever remained in my  ][ native wood, nor ][  ][ known nor felt beyond the sensat
ions of hunger, thirst, and heat! ][  ][ "Of what a strange nature is kn ][ owledge!  It clings to the mind when it ][  ][ has o
nce seized on it like a lichen on the rock.  I wished sometimes to ][  ][ sh ][ ake off all thought and feeling, but I learned t
hat there was but one ][  ][ means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that w ][ as death--a state ][  ][ which I feared yet 
did not understand.  I admired virtue and good ][  ][ feelings and loved the gentle  ][ manners and amiable qualities of my ][  
][ cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except ][  ][ through means ][  which I obtained by stealth, when I
 was unseen and ][  ][ unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had o ][ f ][  ][ becoming one among my f
ellows.  The gentle words of Agatha and  the ][  ][ animated smiles of the charming Arabian were ][  not for me.  The mild ][  ]
[ exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved ][  ][ Felix were not for me. ][  Miserable, unhappy wret
ch! ][  ][ "Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.  I heard of the ][  ][ difference of  ][ sexes, and the birth
 and growth of children, how the ][  ][ father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of  ][ the ][  ][ older
 child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up ][  ][ in the precious charge, how the mind of  ][ youth expand
ed and gained ][  ][ knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which ][  ][ bind one human be ][ ing to a
nother in mutual bonds. ][  ][ "But where were my friends and relations?  No father had watched my ][  ][ infant days, n ][ o mo
ther had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if ][  ][ they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in whi ][ 
ch I ][  ][ distinguished nothing.  From my earliest remembrance I had been as I ][  ][ then was in height and proportion.  I ha
 ][ d never yet seen a being ][  ][ resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.  What was I?  The ][  ][ question agai
n re ][ curred, to be answered only with groans. ][  ][ "I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to 
][  ][ r ][ eturn to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various ][  ][ feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, 
but which al ][ l terminated ][  ][ in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in ][  ][ an innocent, h
alf-painful self ][ -deceit, to call them)." ][  ][ Chapter 14 ][  ][ "Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my frie
nds.  It was ][  ][  ][ one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding ][  ][ as it did a number of cir
cumstances, each interes ][ ting and wonderful to ][  ][ one so utterly inexperienced as I was. ][  ][ "The name of the old man 
was De Lacey.  He was descen ][ ded from a good ][  ][ family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, ][  ][ 
respected by his superiors and b ][ eloved by his equals.  His son was bred ][  ][ in the service of his country, and Agatha had
 ranked with ladies of the ][  ][ hi ][ ghest distinction.  A few months before my arrival they had lived in ][  ][ a large and 
luxurious city called Paris, surrounded  ][ by friends and ][  ][ possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intel
lect, or ][  ][ taste, accompanied by a mode ][ rate fortune, could afford. ][  ][ "The father of Safie had been the cause of th
eir ruin.  He was a ][  ][ Turkish merchant and  ][ had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some ][  ][ reason which I cou
ld not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. ][  ][  ][ He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arriv
ed from ][  ][ Constantinople to join him.  He was tried ][  and condemned to death.  The ][  ][ injustice of his sentence was v
ery flagrant; all Paris was indignant; ][  ][ and it was jud ][ ged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime ][  ][ al
leged against him had been the cause of his condemnation. ][  ][ ][  "Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horr
or and ][  ][ indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the deci ][ sion of the ][  ][ court.  He made, at that moment, a so
lemn vow to deliver him and then ][  ][ looked around for the means.  Af ][ ter many fruitless attempts to gain ][  ][ admittanc
e to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an ][  ][ unguarded pa ][ rt of the building, which lighted the dungeon of
 the ][  ][ unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair t ][ he ][  ][ execution of the barbarous sentenc
e.  Felix visited the grate at night ][  ][ and made known to the prisoner his inten ][ tions in his favour.  The Turk, ][  ][ a
mazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer ][  ][ by promises  ][ of reward and wealth.  Felix rejecte
d his offers with ][  ][ contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visi ][ t ][  ][ her father and who by h
er gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the ][  ][ youth could not help owning to his own mi ][ nd that the captive possesse
d ][  ][ a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard. ][  ][ "The Turk quickly perceived ][  the impression that his
 daughter had made ][  ][ on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in ][  ][ hi ][ s interests by the p
romise of her hand in marriage so soon as he ][  ][ should be conveyed to a place of safety.  Felix was too  ][ delicate to ][  
][ accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the ][  ][ event as to the consummation of his ][  happiness. 
][  ][ "During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for ][  ][ the escape of the merchant, th ][ e zeal o
f Felix was warmed by several ][  ][ letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to ][  ][ express h ][ er t
houghts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old ][  ][ man, a servant of her father who understood French.  She th ][ 
anked him in ][  ][ the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and ][  ][ at the same time she gently d
 ][ eplored her own fate. ][  ][ "I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence ][  ][ in the hovel, to
 pro ][ cure the implements of writing; and the letters ][  ][ were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.  Before I depart I wi
ll ][  ] ][ [ give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, ][  ][ as the sun is already far declined,
 I shall onl ][ y have time to repeat ][  ][ the substance of them to you. ][  ][ "Safie related that her mother was a Christian
 Arab, seized an ][ d made a ][  ][ slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of ][  ][ the father of
 Safie, who married  ][ her.  The young girl spoke in high and ][  ][ enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, sp
urned the ][  ][ bondage ][  to which she was now reduced.  She instructed her daughter in ][  ][ the tenets of her religion and
 taught her to aspire to hig ][ her powers of ][  ][ intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female ][  ][ foll
owers of Muhammad.  This lady di ][ ed, but her lessons were indelibly ][  ][ impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at th
e prospect of again ][  ][ returning ][  to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, ][  ][ allowed only to occupy he
rself with infantile amusements, ill-sui ][ ted to ][  ][ the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble ][  
][ emulation for virtue.  The prospect of ma ][ rrying a Christian and ][  ][ remaining in a country where women were allowed to
 take a rank in ][  ][ society was enchanting to ][  her. ][  ][ "The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the ni
ght ][  ][ previous to it he quitted his prison and  ][ before morning was distant ][  ][ many leagues from Paris.  Felix had pr
ocured passports in the name of ][  ][ his father, siste ][ r, and himself.  He had previously communicated his ][  ][ plan to t
he former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under ][  ][  ][ the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with hi
s daughter, in ][  ][ an obscure part of Paris. ][  ][ "Felix co ][ nducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mon
t ][  ][ Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a  ][ favourable ][  ][ opportunity of passing into some part 
of the Turkish dominions. ][  ][ "Safie resolved to remain with her fath ][ er until the moment of his ][  ][ departure, before 
which time the Turk renewed his promise that she ][  ][ should be united to  ][ his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in ]
[  ][ expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society ][   ][ ][ of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him
 the simplest and tenderest ][  ][ affection.  They conversed with one another throu ][ gh the means of an ][  ][ interpreter, a
nd sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie ][  ][ sang to him the divine a ][ irs of her native country. ][  ][ "T
he Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes ][  ][ of the youthful  ][ lovers, while in his heart he ha
d formed far other ][  ][ plans.  He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a ][ ][   ][ Christian, but he feare
d the resentment of Felix if he should appear ][  ][ lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the  ][ power of his deliverer ]
[  ][ if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they ][  ][ inhabited.  He revolved a ][  thousand plans by w
hich he should be enabled ][  ][ to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and ][  ][ sec ][ retly to take hi
s daughter with him when he departed.  His plans ][  ][ were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris. ] ][ [  ][ "The g
overnment of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their ][  ][ victim and spared no pains to detect and puni ][ sh his d
eliverer.  The ][  ][ plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were ][  ][ thrown into prison.  The ][  new
s reached Felix and roused him from his ][  ][ dream of pleasure.  His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay ][  ] ][ 
[ in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of ][  ][ her whom he loved.  This idea was torture to him.
 ][   He quickly arranged ][  ][ with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity ][  ][ for escape before 
Feli ][ x could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a ][  ][ boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely 
Arabian, ][  ][  ][ he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the ][  ][ law, hoping to free De Lacey an
d Agatha by  ][ this proceeding. ][  ][ "He did not succeed.  They remained confined for five months before the ][  ][ trial too
k place, the res ][ ult of which deprived them of their fortune ][  ][ and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native
 country. ][  ][ "Th ][ ey found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I ][  ][ discovered them.  Felix soon learn
ed that the treacherous  ][ Turk, for ][  ][ whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on ][  ][ discovering th
at his deliverer was thus re ][ duced to poverty and ruin, ][  ][ became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted It
aly with ][  ][ his daughter, in ][ sultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, ][  ][ as he said, in some plan of f
uture maintenance. ][  ][ "Such were ][  the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered ][  ][ him, when I first saw 
him, the most miserable of his family.   ][ He could ][  ][ have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of h
is ][  ][ virtue, he gloried in it; but the  ][ ingratitude of the Turk and the loss ][  ][ of his beloved Safie were misfortune
s more bitter and irreparable.  The ][  ][ arriv ][ al of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul. ][  ][ "When the news 
reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealt ][ h ][  ][ and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more 
of her ][  ][ lover, but to prepare to return to her nat ][ ive country.  The generous ][  ][ nature of Safie was outraged by th
is command; she attempted to ][  ][ expostulate with her fat ][ her, but he left her angrily, reiterating his ][  ][ tyrannical 
mandate. ][  ][ "A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter ][ 's apartment and told ][  ][ her hastily that he had reason 
to believe that his residence at Leghorn ][  ][ had been divulged an ][ d that he should speedily be delivered up to the ][  ][ 
French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to ] ][ [  ][ Constantinople, for which city he should sail 
in a few hours.  He ][  ][ intended to leave his daughter under the care of  ][ a confidential ][  ][ servant, to follow at her 
leisure with the greater part of his ][  ][ property, which had not yet arrived  ][ at Leghorn. ][  ][ "When alone, Safie resolv
ed in her own mind the plan of conduct that it ][  ][ would become her to pursue in  ][ this emergency.  A residence in Turkey ]
[  ][ was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse ][  ][ to it ][ .  By some papers of her father whic
h fell into her hands she ][  ][ heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the  ][ spot where ][  ][ he then reside
d.  She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her ][  ][ determination.  Taking with her ][  some jewels that belonged t
o her and a ][  ][ sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, ][  ][ bu ][ t who understood the com
mon language of Turkey, and departed for ][  ][ Germany. ][  ][ "She arrived in safety at a town about t ][ wenty leagues from t
he cottage ][  ][ of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill.  Safie nursed her ][  ][ with the mo ][ st devoted affec
tion, but the poor girl died, and the ][  ][ Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the count ][ ry ][  ][ an
d utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.  She fell, however, ][  ][ into good hands.  The Italian had mention ][ ed the n
ame of the spot for ][  ][ which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in ][  ][ which they had li ][ ved 
took care that Safie should arrive in safety at ][  ][ the cottage of her lover." ][  ][ Chapter 15 ][  ][ "Such was the his ][ 
tory of my beloved cottagers.  It impressed me deeply. ][  ][ I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to ad
 ][ mire ][  ][ their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind. ][  ][ "As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benev
olen ][ ce and ][  ][ generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to ][  ][ become an actor in the busy 
scene wh ][ ere so many admirable qualities ][  ][ were called forth and displayed.  But in giving an account of the ][  ][ prog
ress of my i ][ ntellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred ][  ][ in the beginning of the month of August of the sa
me year. ][  ][  ][ "One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I ][  ][ collected my own food and brou
ght home firing for  ][ my protectors, I ][  ][ found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles ][  ][ of
 dress and some books.   ][ I eagerly seized the prize and returned with ][  ][ it to my hovel.  Fortunately the books were writ
ten in the language, ][  ][  ][ the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of ][  ][ Paradise Lost, a v
olume of Plutarch's Lives, and t ][ he Sorrows of Werter. ][  ][ The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I no
w ][  ][ continually studied and exe ][ rcised my mind upon these histories, whilst ][  ][ my friends were employed in their ord
inary occupations. ][  ][ "I can hardly  ][ describe to you the effect of these books.  They produced ][  ][ in me an infinity o
f new images and feelings, that sometimes ra ][ ised me ][  ][ to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection
.  In ][  ][ the Sorrows of Werter, besides the  ][ interest of its simple and affecting ][  ][ story, so many opinions are canv
assed and so many lights thrown upon ][  ][ what had ][  hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a ][  ][ never-
ending source of speculation and astonishment.  The gent ][ le and ][  ][ domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sen
timents and ][  ][ feelings, which had for their object some ][ thing out of self, accorded ][  ][ well with my experience among
 my protectors and with the wants which ][  ][ were forever aliv ][ e in my own bosom.  But I thought Werter himself a ][  ][ mo
re divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character ][ ][   ][ contained no pretension, but it sank deep.  The dis
quisitions upon ][  ][ death and suicide were calculated to fill  me wit ][ h wonder.  I did not ][  ][ pretend to enter into th
e merits of the case, yet I inclined towards ][  ][ the opinions of the hero ][ , whose extinction I wept, without precisely ][ 
 ][ understanding it. ][  ][ "As I read, however, I applied much personally to m ][ y own feelings and ][  ][ condition.  I foun
d myself similar yet at the same time strangely ][  ][ unlike to the beings concerni ][ ng whom I read and to whose conversation
 I ][  ][ was a listener.  I sympathized with and partly understood them, but I ][  ][ w ][ as unformed in mind; I was dependent
 on none and related to none. ][  ][ 'The path of my departure was free,' and there was none ][  to lament my ][  ][ annihilatio
n.  My person was hideous and my stature gigantic.  What did ][  ][ this mean?  Who was I?  What ][  was I?  Whence did I come? 
 What was my ][  ][ destination?  These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to ][  ][ s ][ olve them. ][  ][ "The v
olume of Plutarch's Lives which I possessed contained the ][  ][ histories of the first founders of the  ][ ancient republics.  
This book ][  ][ had a far different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter.  I ][  ][ learned from Werte ][ r's imaginations
 despondency and gloom, but Plutarch ][  ][ taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of ][  my ][  ][ o
wn reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.  Many ][  ][ things I read surpassed my understanding an ][ d experi
ence.  I had a very ][  ][ confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, ][  ][ and boundless  ][ seas
.  But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and ][  ][ large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been th ][ 
e ][  ][ only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book ][  ][ developed new and mightier scenes of action.  I r
 ][ ead of men concerned ][  ][ in public affairs, governing or massacring their species.  I felt the ][  ][ greatest ardour for
 vir ][ tue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as ][  ][ far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as
 they ][ ][   ][ were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.  Induced by these ][  ][ feelings, I was of course led to 
admire peace ][ able lawgivers, Numa, ][  ][ Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus.  The ][  ][ patriarchal 
lives of my prot ][ ectors caused these impressions to take a ][  ][ firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to 
humanity had ][  ][  ][ been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should ][  ][ have been imbued with dif
ferent sensations. ][  ] ][ [ "But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions.  I read ][  ][ it, as I had read the
 other volumes which had fal ][ len into my hands, as ][  ][ a true history.  It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the 
][  ][ picture of an omnipotent  ][ God warring with his creatures was capable of ][  ][ exciting.  I often referred the several
 situations, as their similarity ][  ][  ][ struck me, to my own.  Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to ][  ][ any o
ther being in existence; but his state w ][ as far different from mine ][  ][ in every other respect.  He had come forth from th
e hands of God a ][  ][ perfect creature, ha ][ ppy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of ][  ][ his Creator; he was a
llowed to converse with and acquire knowledge fr ][ om ][  ][ beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alo
ne. ][  ][ Many times I considered Satan as the fitt ][ er emblem of my condition, for ][  ][ often, like him, when I viewed the
 bliss of my protectors, the bitter ][  ][ gall of envy  ][ rose within me. ][  ][ "Another circumstance strengthened and confir
med these feelings.  Soon ][  ][ after my arrival in the hov ][ el I discovered some papers in the pocket of ][  ][ the dress wh
ich I had taken from your laboratory.  At first I had ][  ][ neg ][ lected them, but now that I was able to decipher the charact
ers in ][  ][ which they were written, I began to study them with di ][ ligence.  It was ][  ][ your journal of the four months 
that preceded my creation.  You ][  ][ minutely described in these paper ][ s every step you took in the progress ][  ][ of your
 work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic ][  ][ occurrences ][ .  You doubtless recollect these papers.  Here t
hey are. ][  ][ Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accurs ][ ed ][  ][ origin; the whole detail of that s
eries of disgusting circumstances ][  ][ which produced it is set in view; the minut ][ est description of my odious ][  ][ and 
loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own ][  ][ horrors and rendere ][ d mine indelible.  I sickened as I r
ead.  'Hateful ][  ][ day when I received life!' I exclaimed in agony.  'Accursed creator! ] ][ [  ][ Why did you form a monster
 so hideous that even YOU turned from me in ][  ][ disgust?  God, in pity, made man beautiful an ][ d alluring, after his own ][
  ][ image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the ][  ][ very resemblance ][ .  Satan had his compani
ons, fellow devils, to admire ][  ][ and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.' ][  ][ "These w ][ ere the reflections 
of my hours of despondency and solitude; ][  ][ but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their  ][ amiable and ][  
][ benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should ][  ][ become acquainted with my admiration ][  of their vi
rtues they  would ][  ][ compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity.  Could they turn ][  ][ from their doo ][ r one, h
owever monstrous, who solicited their compassion ][  ][ and friendship?  I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in ev ][ ery 
way ][  ][ to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.  I ][  ][ postponed this attempt for some mo ][ 
nths longer, for the importance ][  ][ attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail. ][  ][ Besides, I fo
 ][ und that my understanding improved so much with every ][  ][ day's experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertak
ing  ][ ][  ][ until a few more months should have added to my sagacity. ][  ][ "Several changes, in the meantime, took place in
 the cot ][ tage.  The ][  ][ presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also ][  ][ found that a greater
 degree of p ][ lenty reigned there.  Felix and Agatha ][  ][ spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted i
n ][  ][ their l ][ abours by servants.  They did not appear rich, but they were ][  ][ contented and happy; their feelings were
 serene and peaceful ][ , while ][  ][ mine became every day more tumultuous.  Increase of knowledge only ][  ][ discovered to m
e more clearly what a wr ][ etched outcast I was.  I ][  ][ cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person 
][  ][ reflected in water or ][  my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail ][  ][ image and that inconstant shade. ][  ][ "
I endeavoured to crush these fea ][ rs and to fortify myself for the trial ][  ][ which in a few months I resolved to undergo; a
nd sometimes I allowed my ][  ][ tho ][ ughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and ][  ][ dared to fan
cy amiable and lovely creatures sympathi ][ zing with my ][  ][ feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breat
hed ][  ][ smiles of consolation.  But it wa ][ s all a dream; no Eve soothed my ][  ][ sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was al
one.  I remembered Adam's ][  ][ supplication to ][  his Creator.  But where was mine?  He had abandoned me, ][  ][ and in the b
itterness of my heart I cursed him. ][  ][ "Autumn p ][ assed thus.  I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay ][  ][ and
 fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appe ][ arance it ][  ][ had worn when I first beheld the woods and the love
ly moon.  Yet I did ][  ][ not heed the bleakness of the wea ][ ther; I was better fitted by my ][  ][ conformation for the endu
rance of cold than heat.  But my chief ][  ][ delights were the  ][ sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay ][  ][ appa
rel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention  ][ ][  ][ towards the cottagers.  Their happiness was not d
ecreased by the ][  ][ absence of summer.  They loved and sympathized wi ][ th one another; and ][  ][ their joys, depending on 
each other, were not interrupted by the ][  ][ casualties that took place ar ][ ound them.  The more I saw of them, the ][  ][ g
reater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my ][  ][ heart  ][ yearned to be known and loved by these amiab
le creatures; to see ][  ][ their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was ][  the utmost ][  ][ limit of my ambition.
  I dared not think that they would turn them from ][  ][ me with disdain and horror.  T ][ he poor that stopped at their door w
ere ][  ][ never driven away.  I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a ][  ][ litt ][ le food or rest:  I required kin
dness and sympathy; but I did not ][  ][ believe myself utterly unworthy of it. ][  ][ "The wint ][ er advanced, and an entire r
evolution of the seasons had taken ][  ][ place since I awoke into life.  My attention at this time  ][ was solely ][  ][ direct
ed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my ][  ][ protectors.  I revolved many proj ][ ects, but that on wh
ich I finally ][  ][ fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. ][  ][ I had sa ][ gacity enough to
 discover that the unnatural hideousness of my ][  ][ person was the chief object of horror with those who had f ][ ormerly ][  
][ beheld me.  My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I ][  ][ thought, therefore, that if in the abs ][ ence of 
his children I could gain ][  ][ the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means ][  ][ be tolerat ][ ed b
y my younger protectors. ][  ][ "One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground ][  ][ and diffused c ][ 
heerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, ][  ][ and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his
 ][  own ][  ][ desire, was left alone in the cottage.  When his children had departed, ][  ][ he took up his guitar and played 
seve ][ ral mournful but sweet airs, more ][  ][ sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.  At first his ][  ][ 
countena ][ nce was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued, ][  ][ thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, layi
ng aside the ][  ][  ][ instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection. ][  ][ "My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of 
trial, which ][  ][  ][ would decide my hopes or realize my fears.  The servants were gone to a ][  ][ neighbouring fair.  All w
as silent in and aro ][ und the cottage; it was an ][  ][ excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my ][
  ][ limbs failed me and ][  I sank to the ground.  Again I rose, and exerting ][  ][ all the firmness of which I was master, re
moved the planks which I had ][  ][  ][ placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat.  The fresh air revived ][  ][ me, and with
 renewed determination I approac ][ hed the door of their ][  ][ cottage. ][  ][ "I knocked.  'Who is there?' said the old man. 
 'Come in.' ][  ][ "I entered.  'Par ][ don this intrusion,' said I; 'I am a traveller in want ][  ][ of a little rest; you woul
d greatly oblige me if you would allow m ][ e to ][  ][ remain a few minutes before the fire.' ][  ][ "'Enter,' said De Lacey, '
and I will try in what manner I can to ][  ] ][ [ relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and ][  ][ 
as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it diffi ][ cult to procure food ][  ][ for you.' ][  ][ "'Do not trouble yourself, my k
ind host; I have food; it is warmth and ][  ][ rest  ][ only that I need.' ][  ][ "I sat down, and a silence ensued.  I knew tha
t every minute was ][  ][ precious to me, yet I remained ][  irresolute in what manner to commence ][  ][ the interview, when th
e old man addressed me.  'By your language, ][  ][ stranger, ][  I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?' ][  ][ "'No; 
but I was educated by a French family and understand that ][  ][ ][  language only.  I am now going to claim the protection of s
ome friends, ][  ][ whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I hav ][ e some hopes.' ][  ][ "'Are they Germans?' ][  ][ "'No, 
they are French.  But let us change the subject.  I am an ][  ][ unfortu ][ nate and deserted creature, I look around and I have
 no relation ][  ][ or friend upon earth.  These amiable people to whom I go ][  have never ][  ][ seen me and know little of me
.  I am full of fears, for if I fail ][  ][ there, I am an outcast in the world  ][ forever.' ][  ][ "'Do not despair.  To be fr

 not despair.' ][  ][ "'They are kind--they are the most excellent creatures in the world; ] ][ [  ][ but, unfortunately, they a
re prejudiced against me.  I have good ][  ][ dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless a ][ nd in some degree ][  ][ ben

only a detestable ][  ][ monster.' ][  ][ "'That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, ][  cannot ][  ][ you u
ndeceive them?' ][  ][ "'I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I ][  ][ feel so  ][ many overwhelmin

me.' ][  ][ "'Where do these friends reside?' ][  ][ "'Near this spot.' ][  ][ "The old man paused and then continued, ' ][ If y
ou will unreservedly ][  ][ confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in ][  ][ undeceiving them.  ][ 
 I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but ][  ][ there is something in your words which persuades me that you are ][

lips ][  ][ first have I ][  heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall ][  ][ be forever grateful; and your prese

s and residence of those friends ][ ?' ][  ][ "I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to ][  ][ rob me
 of or bestow happiness on me foreve ][ r.  I struggled vainly for ][  ][ firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort dest
royed all my ][  ][ remaining strength;  ][ I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud.  At that ][  ][ moment I heard the steps of my
 younger protectors.  I had not a moment ][  ][  ][ to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, 'Now is the ][  ][ ti
me!  Save and protect me!  You and your family a ][ re the friends whom I ][  ][ seek.  Do not you desert me in the hour of tria
l!' ][  ][ "'Great God!' exclaimed the old man.  'Wh ][ o are you?' ][  ][ "At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Fel
ix, Safie, and ][  ][ Agatha entered.  Who can describe  ][ their horror and consternation on ][  ][ beholding me?  Agatha faint
ed, and Safie, unable to attend to her ][  ][ friend, rushed ][  out of the cottage.  Felix darted forward, and with ][  ][ supe
rnatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung,  ][ in ][  ][ a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground an
d struck me violently ][  ][ with a stick.  I could have torn him li ][ mb from limb, as the lion rends ][  ][ the antelope.  Bu
t my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and ][  ][ I refraine ][ d.  I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, wh
en, ][  ][ overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the g ][ eneral ][  ][ tumult escaped unperceived to my h
ovel." ][  ][ Chapter 16 ][  ][ "Cursed, cursed creator!  Why did I live?  Why,  ][ in that instant, did I ][  ][ not extinguish
 the spark of existence which you had so wantonly ][  ][ bestowed?  I know not; desp ][ air had not yet taken possession of me; 
my ][  ][ feelings were those of rage and revenge.  I could with pleasure have ][  ][ de ][ stroyed the cottage and its inhabita
nts and have glutted myself with ][  ][ their shrieks and misery. ][  ][ "When night came I  ][ quitted my retreat and wandered 
in the wood; and ][  ][ now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my ][ ][   ][ anguish in fearful howl
ings.  I was like a wild beast that had broken ][  ][ the toils, destroying the objects that obstruc ][ ted me and ranging ][  ]
[ through the wood with a stag-like swiftness.  Oh!  What a miserable ][  ][ night I passed!  The cold s ][ tars shone in mocker
y, and the bare trees ][  ][ waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird ][  ][ bu ][ rst forth amidst
 the universal stillness.  All, save I, were at rest ][  ][ or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell ][  within me, 
and ][  ][ finding myself unsympathized with, wished to tear up the trees, spread ][  ][ havoc and destruction aroun ][ d me, an
d then to have sat down and enjoyed ][  ][ the ruin. ][  ][ "But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I ][  bec
ame ][  ][ fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in ][  ][ the sick impotence of despair.  Ther ][ 
e was none among the myriads of men ][  ][ that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness ][  ][ towards m
 ][ y enemies?  No; from that moment I declared everlasting war ][  ][ against the species, and more than all, against him who h
ad f ][ ormed me ][  ][ and sent me forth to this insupportable misery. ][  ][ "The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew
 that it ][  was ][  ][ impossible to return to my retreat during that day.  Accordingly I hid ][  ][ myself in some thick under
wood, determ ][ ining to devote the ensuing hours ][  ][ to reflection on my situation. ][  ][ "The pleasant sunshine and the pu
re air of day re ][ stored me to some ][  ][ degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the ][  ][ cottage
, I could not help b ][ elieving that I had been too hasty in my ][  ][ conclusions.  I had certainly acted imprudently.  It was
 apparent that ][  ][ my ][  conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and  I was a ][  ][ fool in having exposed my 
person to the horror of his  ][ children.  I ][  ][ ought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to ][  ][ 
have discovered myself to the re ][ st of his family, when they should have ][  ][ been  prepared for my approach.  But I did no
t believe my errors to be ][  ][ irr ][ etrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the ][  ][ cottage, see
k the old man, and by my representations ][  win him to my ][  ][ party. ][  ][ "These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon 
I sank into a profound ][  ][ sleep; but the ][  fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by ][  ][ peaceful dreams.  Th
e horrible scene of the preceding day was foreve ][ r ][  ][ acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Feli
x ][  ][ tearing me from his father's feet.  I awoke ][  exhausted, and finding that ][  ][ it was already night, I crept forth 
from my hiding-place, and went in ][  ][ search of food. ][  ][  ][ "When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards th
e ][  ][ well-known path that conducted to the cottage.  All ][  there was at peace. ][  ][ I crept into my hovel and remained i
n silent expectation of the ][  ][ accustomed hour when the fami ][ ly arose.  That hour passed, the sun ][  ][ mounted high in 
the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear.  I ][  ][ trembled vi ][ olently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune.  The ins
ide ][  ][ of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot desc ][ ribe the ][  ][ agony of this suspense. ][  ][ "Pres
ently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they ][  ][ en ][ tered into conversation, using violent gesticula
tions; but I did not ][  ][ understand what they said, as they spoke the languag ][ e of the country, ][  ][ which differed from
 that of my protectors.  Soon after, however, Felix ][  ][ approached with another m ][ an; I was surprised, as I knew that he h
ad not ][  ][ quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from ][ ][   ][ his discourse the meaning of th
ese unusual appearances. ][  ][ "'Do you consider,' said his companion to him, 'that you wil ][ l be ][  ][ obliged to pay three
 months' rent and to lose the produce of your ][  ][ garden?  I do not wish to take any unfair a ][ dvantage, and I beg ][  ][ t
herefore that you will take some days to consider of your ][  ][ determination.' ][  ][ "'It is utte ][ rly useless,' replied Fe
lix; 'we can never again inhabit ][  ][ your cottage.  The life of my father is in the greatest danger,  ][ owing ][  ][ to the 
dreadful circumstance that I have related.  My wife and my ][  ][ sister will never recover from their horro ][ r.  I entreat yo
u not to ][  ][ reason with me any more.  Take possession of your tenement and let me ][  ][ fly from this place ][ .' ][  ][ "F
elix trembled violently as he said this.  He and his companion ][  ][ entered the cottage, in which they remained fo ][ r a few 
minutes, and then ][  ][ departed.  I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more. ][  ][ "I continued for the remainde ][ r of
 the day in my hovel in a state of ][  ][ utter and stupid despair.  My protectors had departed and had broken ][  ][ the on ][ 
ly link that held me to the world.  For the first time the ][  ][ feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not 
 ][ strive to ][  ][ control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I ][  ][ bent my mind towards injury and 
deat ][ h.  When I thought of my friends, ][  ][ of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the ][  ][ exquis
ite beau ][ ty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of ][  ][ tears somewhat soothed me.  But again when I reflect
ed that they ][  had ][  ][ spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to ][  ][ injure anything human
, I turned my fu ][ ry towards inanimate objects.  As ][  ][ night advanced I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottag
e, ][  ][ and after  ][ having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, ][  ][ I waited with forced impatience unti
l the moon had sunk to c ][ ommence my ][  ][ operations. ][  ][ "As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and 
quickly ][  ][ dispersed the ][  clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore ][  ][ along like a mighty avalanche an
d produced a kind of insanity in ][  my ][  ][ spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.  I lighted the ][  ][ dry
 branch of a tree and danced with fu ][ ry around the devoted cottage, ][  ][ my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the ed
ge of which the moon ][  ][ nearly touch ][ ed.  A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my ][  ][ brand; it sank, and 
with a loud scream I fired the straw, and he ][ ath, ][  ][ and bushes, which I had collected.  The wind fanned the fire, and th
e ][  ][ cottage was quickly enveloped by the fl ][ ames, which clung to it and ][  ][ licked it with their forked and destroyin
g tongues. ][  ][ "As soon as I was convinced that n ][ o assistance could save any part of ][  ][ the habitation, I quitted the
 scene and sought for refuge in the woods. ][  ][ "And n ][ ow, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?  I ][ 
 ][ resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; bu ][ t to me, hated ][  ][ and despised, every country must be equall
y horrible.  At length the ][  ][ thought of you crossed my mind ][ .  I learned from your papers that you ][  ][ were my father
, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness ][  ][ tha ][ n to him who had given me life?  Among the lessons that 
Felix had ][  ][ bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I  ][ had learned from ][  ][ these the relative situation
s of the different countries of the earth. ][  ][ You had mentioned Geneva a ][ s the name of your native town, and towards ][  
][ this place I resolved to proceed. ][  ][ "But how was I to direct myself?  I  ][ knew that I must travel in a ][  ][ southwes
terly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my ][  ][ only guide.  I di ][ d not know the names of the towns that I
 was to pass ][  ][ through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but  ][ I ][  ][ did not despair.  From you 
only could I hope for succour, although ][  ][ towards you I felt no sentiment but that of h ][ atred.  Unfeeling, ][  ][ heartl
ess creator!  You had endowed me with perceptions and passions ][  ][ and then cast me abroad an ][  object for the scorn and ho
rror of mankind. ][  ][ But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I ][  ][  ][ determined to seek that 
justice which I vainly attempted to gain from ][  ][ any other being that wore the human form. ][  ][ "M ][ y travels were long 
and the sufferings I endured intense.  It was ][  ][ late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had  ][ so long resided.
 ][  ][ I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a ][  ][ human being.  Nature decayed a ][ round me, an
d the sun became heatless; ][  ][ rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface ][  ][ of t ][ he earth
 was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.  Oh, ][  ][ earth!  How often did I imprecate curses on the cause ][  of 
my being!  The ][  ][ mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall ][  ][ and bitterness.  The neare ][ 
r I approached to your habitation, the more ][  ][ deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.  Snow ][  ][ f
 ][ ell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.  A few incidents ][  ][ now and then directed me, and I possessed a map
 of  ][ the country; but I ][  ][ often wandered wide from my path.  The agony of my feelings allowed me ][  ][ no respite; no i
ncident  ][ occurred from which my rage and misery could ][  ][ not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I ar
rived ][  ][ ][  on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth ][  ][ and the earth again began to look 
green, confirmed ][  in an especial ][  ][ manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings. ][  ][ "I generally rested during th
e day and travelled  ][ only when I was ][  ][ secured by night from the view of man.  One morning, however, finding ][  ][ that
 my path lay through a d ][ eep wood, I ventured to continue my journey ][  ][ after the sun had risen; the day, which was one o
f the first of spring, ][  ] ][ [ cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of ][  ][ the air.  I felt
 emotions of gentleness and plea ][ sure, that had long ][  ][ appeared dead, revive within me.  Half surprised by the novelty o
f ][  ][ these sensations, I allowed ][  myself to be borne away by them, and ][  ][ forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared
 to be happy.  Soft tears ][  ][ again b ][ edewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with ][  ][ thankfulness towards t
he blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon ][  me. ][  ][ "I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to it
s ][  ][ boundary, which was skirted by a deep a ][ nd rapid river, into which many ][  ][ of the trees bent their branches, now
 budding with the fresh spring. ][  ][ Here I paused ][ , not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard ][  ][ the sound
 of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the  ][ shade ][  ][ of a cypress.  I was scarcely hid when a young girl cam
e running ][  ][ towards the spot where I was concealed, lau ][ ghing, as if she ran from ][  ][ someone in sport.  She continue
d her course along the precipitous sides ][  ][ of the river, wh ][ en suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the ][  ][ r
apid stream.  I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, ][  ][  ][ from the force of the current, saved her and dra
gged her to shore.  She ][  ][ was senseless, and I endeavoured by every ][  means in my power to restore ][  ][ animation, when
 I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, ][  ][ who was prob ][ ably the person from whom she had playfully fled
.  On ][  ][ seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, ][  ][  ][ hastened towards the deeper parts of
 the wood.  I followed speedily, I ][  ][ hardly knew why; but when the man saw me d ][ raw near, he aimed a gun, ][  ][ which h
e carried, at my body and fired.  I sank to the ground, and my ][  ][ injurer, with incr ][ eased swiftness, escaped into the wo
od. ][  ][ "This was then the reward of my benevolence!  I had saved a human being ][  ][ fr ][ om destruction, and as a recompe
nse I now writhed under the miserable ][  ][ pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. ][   The feelings of ][  ][ kin
dness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments ][  ][ before gave place to hellish r ][ age and gnashing of teet
h.  Inflamed by ][  ][ pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.  But the ][  ][ agony  ][ of my wound overcame
 me; my pulses paused, and I fainted. ][  ][ "For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouri ][ ng to ][  ][ cur
e the wound which I had received.  The ball had entered my shoulder, ][  ][ and I knew not whether it had remain ][ ed there or 
passed through; at any ][  ][ rate I had no means of extracting it.  My sufferings were augmented ][  ][ also by the ][  oppress
ive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their ][  ][ infliction.  My daily vows rose for revenge--a deep and deadl ][ y re
venge, ][  ][ such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had ][  ][ endured. ][  ][ "After some weeks my  ][ 
wound healed, and I continued my journey.  The ][  ][ labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or ][ 
 ][  ][ gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my ][  ][ desolate state and made me feel more painfu
lly  ][ that I was not made for ][  ][ the enjoyment of pleasure. ][  ][ "But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months 
from thi ][ s time I ][  ][ reached the environs of Geneva. ][  ][ "It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-pla
ce among ][  ][  ][ the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply ][  ][ to you.  I was oppressed by fat
igue and hunger  ][ and far too unhappy to ][  ][ enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting ][  ][ 
behind the stupendou ][ s mountains of Jura. ][  ][ "At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, ][  ][
 which was disturbed by  ][ the approach of a beautiful child, who came ][  ][ running into the recess I had chosen, with all th
e sportiveness of ][  ][ inf ][ ancy.  Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this ][  ][ little creature was unpre
judiced and had lived too short  ][ a time to have ][  ][ imbibed a horror of deformity.  If, therefore, I could seize him and ]
[  ][ educate him as my companion an ][ d friend, I should not be so desolate in ][  ][ this peopled earth. ][  ][ "Urged by thi
s impulse, I seized on the boy as he pas ][ sed and drew him ][  ][ towards me.  As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his han
ds before ][  ][ his eyes and uttered a shri ][ ll scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his ][  ][ face and said, 'Child, what 
is the meaning of this?  I do not intend to ][   ][ ][ hurt you; listen to me.' ][  ][ "He struggled violently.  'Let me go,' he
 cried; 'monster!  Ugly ][  ][ wretch!  You wish to  ][ eat me and tear me to pieces.  You are an ogre. ][  ][ Let me go, or I w
ill tell my papa.' ][  ][ "'Boy, you will never see your ][  father again; you must come with me.' ][  ][ "'Hideous monster!  Le
t me go.  My papa is a syndic--he is M. ][  ][ Frankenstein- ][ -he will punish you.  You dare not keep me.' ][  ][ "'Frankenste
in! you belong then to my enemy--to him towards whom I have ][   ][ ][ sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.' ][ 
 ][ "The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which car ][ ried ][  ][ despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to
 silence him, and in a ][  ][ moment he lay dead at my feet. ][  ][ "I g ][ azed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultat
ion and hellish ][  ][ triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, 'I too can c ][ reate desolation; ][  ][ my enemy is not invulne
rable; this death will carry despair to him, and ][  ][ a thousand other miserie ][ s shall torment and destroy him.' ][  ][ "As
 I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his ][  ][ breast.  I t ][ ook it; it was a portrait of a most love
ly woman.  In spite ][  ][ of my malignity, it softened and attracted me.  For a few mom ][ ents I ][  ][ gazed with delight on 
her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her ][  ][ lovely lips; but presently my rage ret ][ urned; I remembered that I was ]
[  ][ forever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could ][  ][ bestow and tha ][ t she whose resemblance I co
ntemplated would, in ][  ][ regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one ][  ][ ex ][ pressive of disgust and 
affright. ][  ][ "Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?  I only ][  ][ wonder that ][  at that moment, ins
tead of venting my sensations in ][  ][ exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in t ][ he ][  ][ attemp
t to destroy them. ][  ][ "While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had ][  ][ committed  ][ the murder, 
and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I ][  ][ entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty.  A woman was ][  ][  ][ 
sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her ][  ][ whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable  ][ aspe
ct and blooming in the ][  ][ loveliness of youth and health.  Here, I thought, is one of those whose ][  ][ joy-imparting s ][ 
miles are bestowed on all but me.  And then I bent over ][  ][ her and whispered, 'Awake, fairest, thy lover is near--he who wou
 ][ ld ][  ][ give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my ][  ][ beloved, awake!' ][  ][ "The sleeper 
stir ][ red; a thrill of terror ran through me.  Should she ][  ][ indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murd
erer? Th ][ us ][  ][ would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me. ][  ][ The thought was madness; it 
stirred the  ][ fiend within me--not I, but ][  ][ she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am forever ][  ][ ro
bbed of all that ][  she could give me, she shall atone.  The crime had ][  ][ its source in her; be hers the punishment!  Thank
s to the lessons of  ][ ][  ][ Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work ][  ][ mischief.  I bent over her
 and placed the portrait ][  securely in one of ][  ][ the folds of her dress.  She moved again, and I fled. ][  ][ "For some da
ys I haunted the spot where  ][ these scenes had taken place, ][  ][ sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit th
e world and ][  ][ its miseries  ][ forever.  At length I wandered towards these mountains, ][  ][ and have ranged through their
 immense recesses, consumed by a bur ][ ning ][  ][ passion which you alone can gratify.  We may not part until you have ][  ][ 
promised to comply with my requisition.  ][  I am alone and miserable; man ][  ][ will not associate with me; but one as deforme
d and horrible as myself ][  ][ would not de ][ ny herself to me.  My companion must be of the same species ][  ][ and have the 
same defects.  This being you must create." ][   ][ ][ Chapter 17 ][  ][ The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me
 in the ][  ][ expectation of a reply.  But I was be ][ wildered, perplexed, and unable to ][  ][ arrange my ideas sufficiently 
to understand the full extent of his ][  ][ proposition. ][   He continued, ][  ][ "You must create a female for me with whom I 
can live in the ][  ][ interchange of those sympathies neces ][ sary for my being.  This you alone ][  ][ can do, and I demand i
t of you as a right which you must not refuse to ][  ][ concede. ][ " ][  ][ The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me 
the anger that had ][  ][ died away while he narrated his peaceful l ][ ife among the cottagers, and ][  ][ as he said this I co
uld no longer suppress the rage that burned within ][  ][ me. ][  ][ "I  ][ do refuse it," I replied; "and no torture shall ever
 extort a ][  ][ consent from me.  You may render me the most miserable of m ][ en, but you ][  ][ shall never make me base in m
y own eyes.  Shall I create another like ][  ][ yourself, whose joint wickedness ][  might desolate the world.  Begone!  I ][  ]
[ have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent." ][  ][ "You are  ][ in the wrong," replied the fiend; "and i
nstead of threatening, ][  ][ I am content to reason with you.  I am malicious because I ][  am ][  ][ miserable.  Am I not shun
ned and hated by all mankind?  You, my ][  ][ creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph;  ][ remember that, and tell ][  ][ m
e why I should pity man more than he pities me?  You would not call it ][  ][ murder if you coul ][ d precipitate me into one of
 those ice-rifts and ][  ][ destroy my frame, the work of your own hands.  Shall I respect man when  ][ ][  ][ he condemns me?  
Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, ][  ][ and instead of injury I would bestow every b ][ enefit upon him with
 tears ][  ][ of gratitude at his acceptance.  But that cannot be; the human senses ][  ][ are insurmountabl ][ e barriers to ou
r union.  Yet mine shall not be the ][  ][ submission of abject slavery.  I will revenge my injuries; if I canno ][ t ][  ][ ins
pire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, ][  ][ because my creator, do I swear inextingu ][ ishable 
hatred.  Have a care; I ][  ][ will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, ][  ][ so that you ][  sha
ll curse the hour of your birth." ][  ][ A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled ][  ][ into con ][ 
tortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently ][  ][ he calmed himself and proceeded-- ][  ][ "I intended to rea
 ][ son.  This passion is detrimental to me, for you do ][  ][ not reflect that YOU are the cause of its excess.  If any being f
elt  ][ ][  ][ emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and ][  ][ a hundredfold; for that one creatur
e's sake ][  I would make peace with the ][  ][ whole kind!  But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be ][  ][ realized
.  What I as ][ k of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a ][  ][ creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gr
atification is ] ][ [  ][ small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me.  It ][  ][ is true, we shall be mons
ters, cut off from a ][ ll the world; but on that ][  ][ account we shall be more attached to one another.  Our lives will not ]
[  ][ be happy, but they ][  will be harmless and free from the misery I now ][  ][ feel.  Oh!  My creator, make me happy; let m
e feel gratitude towards ][  ][  ][ you for one benefit!  Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some ][  ][ existing thing; d
o not deny me my request!" ][  ] ][ [ I was moved.  I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences ][  ][ of my consent
, but I felt that there was some jus ][ tice in his argument. ][  ][ His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be
 a creature ][  ][ of fine sensations, a ][ nd did I not as his maker owe him all the portion ][  ][ of happiness that it was in
 my power to bestow?  He saw my change of ][ ][   ][ feeling and continued, ][  ][ "If you consent, neither you nor any other hu
man being shall ever see ][  ][ us again; I will ][  go to the vast wilds of South America.  My food is not ][  ][ that of man; 
I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my app ][ etite; ][  ][ acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.  My c
ompanion will ][  ][ be of the same nature as myself and ][  will be content with the same fare. ][  ][ We shall make our bed of
 dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on ][  ][ man and ][  will ripen our food.  The picture I present to you is peaceful 
][  ][ and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only  ][ in the ][  ][ wantonness of power and cruelty.  Pitiless as 
you have been towards me, ][  ][ I now see compassion in your eyes;  ][ let me seize the favourable moment ][  ][ and persuade y
ou to promise what I so ardently desire." ][  ][ "You propose," replied  ][ I, "to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell ][ 
 ][ in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only ][  ][ co ][ mpanions.  How can you, who long for the love an
d sympathy of man, ][  ][ persevere in this exile?  You will return and again se ][ ek their ][  ][ kindness, and you will meet 
with their detestation; your evil passions ][  ][ will be renewed, and you will then ][  have a companion to aid you in the ][  
][ task of destruction.  This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I ][  ][ cannot  ][ consent." ][  ][ "How inconstant are
 your feelings!  But a moment ago you were moved by ][  ][ my representations, and why do yo ][ u again harden yourself to my ][
  ][ complaints?  I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you ][  ][ that made me,  ][ that with the companion you 
bestow I will quit the ][  ][ neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage o ][ f ][  ][ places.  My evi
l passions will have fled, for I shall meet with ][  ][ sympathy!  My life will flow quietly away, and i ][ n my dying moments I
 ][  ][ shall not curse my maker." ][  ][ His words had a strange effect upon me.  I compassionated him and  ][ ][  ][ sometimes
 felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when ][  ][ I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked ][ , my heart s
ickened and my ][  ][ feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred.  I tried to stifle ][  ][ these sensation ][ s; I tho
ught that as I could not sympathize with him, I ][  ][ had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness  ][ whic
h ][  ][ was yet in my power to bestow. ][  ][ "You swear," I said, "to be harmless; but have you not already shown a ][  ][ ][ 
 degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you?  May not ][  ][ even this be a feint that will increase your triu
 ][ mph by affording a ][  ][ wider scope for your revenge?" ][  ][ "How is this?  I must not be trifled with, and I demand an a
nswe ][ r.  If ][  ][ I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; ][  ][ the love of another will dest
roy the  ][ cause of my crimes, and I shall ][  ][ become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant.  My vices ][  ][
 are the chi ][ ldren of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will ][  ][ necessarily arise when I live in communion w
ith an equal.  I ][  shall feel ][  ][ the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of ][  ][ existence an
d events from which  ][ I am now excluded." ][  ][ I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various ][  ][ ar
guments which he had emp ][ loyed.  I thought of the promise of virtues ][  ][ which he had displayed on the opening of his exis
tence and the ][  ][ subsequ ][ ent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which ][  ][ his protectors had manif
ested towards him.  His power an ][ d threats were ][  ][ not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice 
][  ][ caves of the glaciers and hid ][ e himself from pursuit among the ridges of ][  ][ inaccessible precipices was a being po
ssessing faculties it would be ][  ][ va ][ in to cope with.  After a long pause of reflection I concluded that ][  ][ the justi
ce due both to him and my fellow creatures d ][ emanded of me that ][  ][ I should comply with his request.  Turning to him, the
refore, I said, ][  ][ "I consent to your demand ][ , on your solemn oath to quit Europe forever, ][  ][ and every other place i
n the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall ][  ] ][ [ deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.
" ][  ][ "I swear," he cried, "by the sun, and by the bl ][ ue sky of heaven, and by ][  ][ the fire of love that burns my heart
, that if you grant my prayer, ][  ][ while they exist you s ][ hall never behold me again.  Depart to your home ][  ][ and comm
ence your labours; I shall watch their progress with ][  ][ unut ][ terable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I 
shall ][  ][ appear." ][  ][ Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fe ][ arful, perhaps, of any change in ][  ][ my sentiments.  
I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than ][  ][ the flight ][  of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations
 of the ][  ][ sea of ice. ][  ][ His tale had occupied the whole day, and t ][ he sun was upon the verge of ][  ][ the horizon 
when he departed.  I knew that I ought to hasten my descent ][  ][ towards the v ][ alley, as I should soon be encompassed in da
rkness; but my ][  ][ heart was heavy, and my steps slow.  The labour of winding amo ][ ng the ][  ][ little paths of the mounta
in and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced ][  ][ perplexed me, occupied as I was by the ][  emotions which the occurrences ][  
][ of the day had produced.  Night was far advanced when I came to the ][  ][ halfway restin ][ g-place and seated myself beside
 the fountain.  The stars ][  ][ shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dar ][ k pines ][  ][ rose before m
e, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ][  ][ ground; it was a scene of wonderful sole ][ mnity and stirred strang
e ][  ][ thoughts within me.  I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I ][  ][ exclaimed, "Oh!  ][  Stars and clouds an
d winds, ye are all about to mock ][  ][ me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become ][  as ][  ][ nough
t; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness." ][  ][ These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I c ][ annot descri
be to you ][  ][ how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I ][  ][ listened to every blast of  ][ wind as 
if it were a dull ugly siroc on its ][  ][ way to consume me. ][  ][ Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of C ][ hamo
unix; I took no ][  ][ rest, but returned immediately to Geneva.  Even in my own heart I could ][  ][ give no expression to  ][ 
my sensations--they weighed on me with a ][  ][ mountain's weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them. ][  ][ Thus 
 ][ I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the ][  ][ family.  My haggard and wild appearance awoke intens
e al ][ arm, but I ][  ][ answered no question, scarcely did I speak.  I felt as if I were placed ][  ][ under a ban--as if I ha
d no rig ][ ht to claim their sympathies--as if ][  ][ never more might I enjoy companionship with them.  Yet even thus I ][  ][
 loved them  ][ to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate ][  ][ myself to my most abhorred task.  The prospect of 
such an occupati ][ on ][  ][ made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream, ][  ][ and that thought on
ly had to me the rea ][ lity of life. ][  ][ Chapter 18 ][  ][ Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Genev
a; and ][  ][ I could no ][ t collect the courage to recommence my work.  I feared the ][  ][ vengeance of the disappointed fien
d, yet I was unable to overc ][ ome my ][  ][ repugnance to the task which was enjoined me.  I found that I could not ][  ][ com
pose a female without again devo ][ ting several months to profound ][  ][ study and laborious disquisition.  I had heard of som
e discoveries ][  ][ having been mad ][ e by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was ][  ][ material to my success, a
nd I sometimes thought of obtaining my ] ][ [  ][ father's consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to ][  ][ ever
y pretence of delay and shrank from taking t ][ he first step in an ][  ][ undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear
 less absolute to ][  ][ me.  A change indeed ha ][ d taken place in me; my health, which had ][  ][ hitherto declined, was now 
much restored; and my spirits, when ][  ][ unchecked ][  by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably.  My ][  ][ fa
ther saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his th ][ oughts ][  ][ towards the best method of eradicating the remains of 
my melancholy, ][  ][ which every now and then would return  ][ by fits, and with a devouring ][  ][ blackness overcast the appr
oaching sunshine.  At these moments I took ][  ][ refuge in the  ][ most perfect solitude.  I passed whole days on the lake ][  
][ alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the  ][ ][  ][ rippling of the waves, silent and listless.  But 
the fresh air and ][  ][ bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some  ][ degree of composure, and ][  ][ on my return I met t
he salutations of my friends with a readier smile ][  ][ and a more cheerful ][  heart. ][  ][ It was after my return from one o
f these rambles that my father, ][  ][ calling me aside, thus addressed me, ][   ][ ][ "I am happy to remark, my dear son, that 
you have resumed your former ][  ][ pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself.  ][  And yet you are still ][  ][ unhappy an
d still avoid our society.  For some time I was lost in ][  ][ conjecture as to the caus ][ e of this, but yesterday an idea str
uck me, ][  ][ and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it.  Reserve on such a ][  ] ][ [ point would be not only useles
s, but draw down treble misery on us all." ][  ][ I trembled violently at his exordium, and my f ][ ather continued--"I ][  ][ c
onfess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage ][  ][ with our dear Elizabeth as ][  the tie of our domestic
 comfort and the stay ][  ][ of my declining years.  You were attached to each other from your ][  ][ ea ][ rliest infancy; you 
studied together, and appeared, in dispositions ][  ][ and tastes, entirely suited to one another.  But so b ][ lind is the ][  
][ experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my ][  ][ plan may have entirely destroy ][ ed it.  You,
 perhaps, regard her as your ][  ][ sister, without any wish that she might become your wife.  Nay, you may ][  ][ h ][ ave met 
with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as ][  ][ bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occas ][ ion 
the poignant ][  ][ misery which you appear to feel." ][  ][ "My dear father, reassure yourself.  I love my cousin tenderly  ][ 
and ][  ][ sincerely.  I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my ][  ][ warmest admiration and affection.  My fut
 ][ ure hopes and prospects are ][  ][ entirely bound up in the expectation of our union." ][  ][ "The expression of your sentim
ents ][  of this subject, my dear Victor, ][  ][ gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced.  If you ][  ][ fe
el thus, ][  we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast ][  ][ a gloom over us.  But it is this gloom which ap
pears to hav ][ e taken so ][  ][ strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate.  Tell me, ][  ][ therefore, whether you o
bject to an imme ][ diate solemnization of the ][  ][ marriage.  We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us ][  ]
[ from that everyday ][  tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You ][  ][ are younger; yet I do not suppose, possesse
d as you are of a compet ][ ent ][  ][ fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future ][  ][ plans of ho
nour and utility that you ma ][ y have formed.  Do not suppose, ][  ][ however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that 
a delay on ][  ][ your part woul ][ d cause me any serious uneasiness.  Interpret my words ][  ][ with candour and answer me, I 
conjure you, with confidence and ][  ][  ][ sincerity." ][  ][ I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time inc
apable ][  ][ of offering any reply.  I  ][ revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of ][  ][ thoughts and endeavoured to arrive
 at some conclusion.  Alas!  To me ][  ][ th ][ e idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and ][  ][ dism
ay.  I was bound by a solemn promise which I had ][  not yet fulfilled ][  ][ and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold mi
series might not ][  ][ impend over me and my devote ][ d family!  Could I enter into a festival ][  ][ with this deadly weight 
yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ][  ][ gr ][ ound?  I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with 
][  ][ his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight ][  of a union from ][  ][ which I expected peace. ][  ][ I remembe
red also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to ] ][ [  ][ England or entering into a long correspondence with th
ose philosophers ][  ][ of that country whose knowledge and discover ][ ies were of indispensable ][  ][ use to me in my present
 undertaking.  The latter method of obtaining ][  ][ the desired intelli ][ gence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I ][
  ][ had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my ][  ][  ][ loathsome task in my father's house while in
 habits of familiar ][  ][ intercourse with those I loved.  I knew that a thousa ][ nd fearful ][  ][ accidents might occur, the
 slightest of which would disclose a tale to ][  ][ thrill all connected with me wit ][ h horror.  I was aware also that I ][  ]
[ should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the ][  ][ harrowing sensat ][ ions that would possess me during th
e progress of my ][  ][ unearthly occupation.  I must absent myself from all I loved while t ][ hus ][  ][ employed.  Once comme
nced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be ][  ][ restored to my family in peace and hap ][ piness.  My promise fulfille
d, ][  ][ the monster would depart forever.  Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some ][  ][ accident might ][  meanwhile occur to dest
roy him and put an end to my ][  ][ slavery forever. ][  ][ These feelings dictated my answer to my fath ][ er.  I expressed a w
ish to ][  ][ visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I ][  ][ clothed my desires un ][ der a guise whic
h excited no suspicion, while I ][  ][ urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to ][   ][ ][ comply.  
After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that ][  ][ resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was ][  glad to
 find ][  ][ that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, ][  ][ and he hoped that change of sce ][ ne a
nd varied amusement would, before my ][  ][ return, have restored me entirely to myself. ][  ][ The duration of my absence w ][ 
as left to my own choice; a few months, or ][  ][ at most a year, was the period contemplated.  One paternal kind ][  ][ precaut
 ][ ion he had taken to ensure my having a companion.  Without ][  ][ previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with 
Eliz ][ abeth, ][  ][ arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasbourg.  This interfered ][  ][ with the solitude I coveted fo
r the pr ][ osecution of my task; yet at the ][  ][ commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be ][  
][ an impedi ][ ment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many ][  ][ hours of lonely, maddening reflection.  Nay, 
Henry might stan ][ d between ][  ][ me and the intrusion of my foe.  If I were alone, would he not at times ][  ][ force his ab
horred presence on m ][ e to remind me of my task or to ][  ][ contemplate its progress? ][  ][ To England, therefore, I was bou
nd, and it was understoo ][ d that my union ][  ][ with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.  My father's ][  ]
[ age rendered him extremely ][  averse to delay.  For myself, there was one ][  ][ reward I promised myself from my detested to
ils--one consolation for my ][   ][ ][ unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, ][  ][ enfranchised from m
y miserable slavery, I might claim E ][ lizabeth and ][  ][ forget the past in my union with her. ][  ][ I now made arrangements
 for my journey, but one feeling haunted ][  me ][  ][ which filled me with fear and agitation.  During my absence I should ][  
][ leave my friends unconscious of the exist ][ ence of their enemy and ][  ][ unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he m
ight be by my ][  ][ departure.  But he had prom ][ ised to follow me wherever I might go, and ][  ][ would he not accompany me 
to England?  This imagination was dreadful in ][  ][ ][  itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends. 
][  ][ I was agonized with the idea of the possibility t ][ hat the reverse of ][  ][ this might happen.  But through the whole 
period during which I was the ][  ][ slave of my creature I  ][ allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of ][  ][ the mome
nt; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend  ][ ][  ][ would follow me and exempt my family from the danger 
of his ][  ][ machinations. ][  ][ It was in the latter end of Septe ][ mber that I again quitted my native ][  ][ country.  My 
journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth ][  ][ therefore acqui ][ esced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea 
of ][  ][ my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.  It  ][ had ][  ][ been her care which provided me a com
panion in Clerval--and yet a man ][  ][ is blind to a thousand minute circumstan ][ ces which call forth a woman's ][  ][ sedulo
us attention.  She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand ][  ][ conflicting  ][ emotions rendered her mute as she bade m
e a tearful, silent ][  ][ farewell. ][  ][ I threw myself into the carriage that was to ][  convey me away, hardly ][  ][ knowi
ng whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. ][  ][ I remembered only, a ][ nd it was with a bitter anguish 
that I reflected on ][  ][ it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with ][  ][  ][ me.  Filled with dre
ary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful ][  ][ and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed ][  and unobserving.  I cou
ld ][  ][ only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy ][  ][ me whilst they  ][ endured. ][  ][ Afte
r some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed ][  ][ many leagues, I arrived at Strasbou ][ rg, where I wait
ed two days for ][  ][ Clerval.  He came.  Alas, how great was the contrast between us!  He ][  ][ was alive to  ][ every new sc
ene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the ][  ][ setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence ][  a new ]
[  ][ day.  He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and ][  ][ the appearances of the sky.  "This is  ][ what
 it is to live," he cried; ][  ][ "how I enjoy existence!  But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are ][  ][ you despondin ][ 
g and sorrowful!" In truth, I was occupied by gloomy ][  ][ thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the gol
 ][ den ][  ][ sunrise reflected in the Rhine.  And you, my friend, would be far more ][  ][ amused with the journal of Clerval,
 who ][  observed the scenery with an ][  ][ eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.  I, a ][  ][ miser
able wre ][ tch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to ][  ][ enjoyment. ][  ][ We had agreed to descend the Rhine in 
a boat from  ][ Strasbourg to ][  ][ Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.  During this ][  ][ voyage we passed m
any willowy isla ][ nds and saw several beautiful towns. ][  ][ We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure
 from ][  ][ Strasbo ][ urg, arrived at Mainz.  The course of the Rhine below Mainz ][  ][ becomes much more picturesque.  The r
iver descends rapidly an ][ d winds ][  ][ between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.  We saw ][  ][ many ruine
d castles standing on the ed ][ ges of precipices, surrounded by ][  ][ black woods, high and inaccessible.  This part of the Rh
ine, indeed, ][  ][ presents a s ][ ingularly variegated landscape.  In one spot you view ][  ][ rugged hills, ruined castles ov
erlooking tremendous precipices, wit ][ h ][  ][ the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, ][  ][ 
flourishing vineyards with green sloping ][  banks and a meandering river ][  ][ and populous towns occupy the scene. ][  ][ We 
travelled at the time of the vintage and hea ][ rd the song of the ][  ][ labourers as we glided down the stream.  Even I, depre
ssed in mind, and ][  ][ my spirits continually  ][ agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. ][  ][ I lay at the bottom 
of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue ][ ][   ][ sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a
 ][  ][ stranger.  And if these were my sensations, who  ][ can describe those of ][  ][ Henry?  He felt as if he had been trans
ported to fairy-land and enjoyed ][  ][ a happiness seldom t ][ asted by man.  "I have seen," he said, "the most ][  ][ beautifu
l scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne  ][ ][  ][ and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost per
pendicularly to ][  ][ the water, casting black and impenetrable sha ][ des, which would cause a ][  ][ gloomy and mournful appe
arance were it not for the most verdant islands ][  ][ that believe the  ][ eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake ]
[  ][ agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and ] ][ [  ][ gave you an idea of what the water-spout m
ust be on the great ocean; ][  ][ and the waves dash with fury the base of the m ][ ountain, where the priest ][  ][ and his mis
tress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying ][  ][ voices are still ][  said to be heard amid the pauses of the
 nightly wind; ][  ][ I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but  ][ this ][  ][ country, Victor, pleases
 me more than all those wonders.  The mountains ][  ][ of Switzerland are more majestic and  ][ strange, but there is a charm in
 ][  ][ the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.  Look ][  ][ at that ca ][ stle which overhangs yon pre
cipice; and that also on the ][  ][ island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely tre ][ es; and ][  ][ now that 
group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that ][  ][ village half hid in the recess of the  ][ mountain.  Oh, surel
y the spirit ][  ][ that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man ][  ][ than thos ][ e who pile the g
lacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of ][  ][ the mountains of our own country." Clerval!  Beloved friend ][ !  Even now 
][  ][ it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which ][  ][ you are so eminently deserving ][ .  He wa
s a being formed in the "very ][  ][ poetry of nature." His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened ][  ][ by th ][ e se
nsibility of his heart.  His soul overflowed with ardent ][  ][ affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondr ][ 
ous nature ][  ][ that the world-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. But ][  ][ even human sympathies were not 
 ][ sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. ][  ][ The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with ][  ][ admiration
, he ][  loved with ardour:-- ][  ][      ----The sounding cataract ][  ][      Haunted him like a passion:  the tall rock, ][  
][       ][ The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, ][  ][      Their colours and their forms, were then to him ][  ][      
An appetite; ][  a feeling, and a love, ][  ][      That had no need of a remoter charm, ][  ][      By thought supplied, or any
 interest ][  ][ ][       Unborrow'd from the eye. ][  ][                     [Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey".] ][  ][ And where d
oes he now exist?  I ][ s this gentle and lovely being lost ][  ][ forever?  Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations 
fanciful ][  ][ and magn ][ ificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the ][  ][ life of its creator;--has this
 mind perished?  Does it now ][  only exist ][  ][ in my memory?  No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and ][  ][ 
beaming with beauty, has decayed ][ , but your spirit still visits and ][  ][ consoles your unhappy friend. ][  ][ Pardon this g
ush of sorrow; these ineffectual wor ][ ds are but a slight ][  ][ tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my 
heart, ][  ][ overflowing with the angui ][ sh which his remembrance creates.  I will ][  ][ proceed with my tale. ][  ][ Beyond
 Cologne we descended to the plains of Holla ][ nd; and we resolved ][  ][ to post the remainder of our way, for the wind was co
ntrary and the ][  ][ stream of the river was to ][ o gentle to aid us.  Our journey here lost ][  ][ the interest arising from 
beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few ][  ][ da ][ ys at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.  It was on a ][ 
 ][ clear morning, in the latter days of December, that  ][ I first saw the ][  ][ white cliffs of Britain.  The banks of the Th
ames presented a new ][  ][ scene; they were flat but fertil ][ e, and almost every town was marked by ][  ][ the remembrance of
 some story.  We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the ][  ][ Span ][ ish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich--places which
 I had ][  ][ heard of even in my country. ][  ][ At length we saw t ][ he numerous steeples of London, St. Paul's towering ][  
][ above all, and the Tower famed in English history. ][  ][ Chapter 19  ][ ][  ][ London was our present point of rest; we dete
rmined to remain several ][  ][ months in this wonderful and celebrated city ][ .  Clerval desired the ][  ][ intercourse of the
 men of genius and talent who flourished at this ][  ][ time, but this was with  ][ me a secondary object; I was principally ][ 
 ][ occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the ][  ][ co ][ mpletion of my promise and quickly avail
ed myself of the letters of ][  ][ introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to ][  the most ][  ][ distinguished natur
al philosophers. ][  ][ If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happines ][ s, ][  ][ it would have afforded
 me inexpressible pleasure.  But a blight had ][  ][ come over my existence, and I only visited  ][ these people for the sake of
 ][  ][ the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest ][  ][ was so terribl ][ y profound.  Company was
 irksome to me; when alone, I ][  ][ could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice o ][ f ][  ][ Henry sooth
ed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory ][  ][ peace.  But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces  ][ brought back des
pair to ][  ][ my heart.  I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my ][  ][ fellow men; this barri ][ er was seale
d with the blood of William and ][  ][ Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled ][  ] ][ [ my sou
l with anguish. ][  ][ But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive ][  ][ and anxious to gain e ][ xper
ience and instruction.  The difference of ][  ][ manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of ][  ][ inst ][ 
ruction and amusement.  He was also pursuing an object he had long ][  ][ had in view.  His design was to visit India, in the be
 ][ lief that he had ][  ][ in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had ][  ][ taken of its society, the 
mean ][ s of materially assisting the progress of ][  ][ European colonization and trade.  In Britain only could he further the 
][  ][ e ][ xecution of his plan.  He was forever busy, and the only check to his ][  ][ enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejecte
d mind.  I t ][ ried to conceal this ][  ][ as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures ][  ][ natural to
 one who was ent ][ ering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by ][  ][ any care or bitter recollection.  I often refused to acc
ompany him, ][  ][ a ][ lleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.  I now also ][  ][ began to collect the materials
 necessary for my new cr ][ eation, and this ][  ][ was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling ][  
][ on the head.  Every thoug ][ ht that was devoted to it was an extreme ][  ][ anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion
 to it caused my lips ][  ][ to  ][ quiver, and my heart to palpitate. ][  ][ After passing some months in London, we received a
 letter from a person ][  ][ in Scot ][ land who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.  He mentioned ][  ][ the beauties of h
is native country and asked us if those  ][ were not ][  ][ sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far no
rth ][  ][ as Perth, where he resided.  Cler ][ val eagerly desired to accept this ][  ][ invitation, and I, although I abhorred
 society, wished to view again ][  ][ mountains  ][ and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature ][  ][ adorns her c
hosen dwelling-places.  We had arrived in England at ][  the ][  ][ beginning of October, and it was now February.  We according
ly ][  ][ determined to commence our journey towards the ][  north at the expiration ][  ][ of another month.  In this expeditio
n we did not intend to follow the ][  ][ great road to Edinb ][ urgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the ][  ][ Cumb
erland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour ][  ][  ][ about the end of July.  I packed up my chemical inst
ruments and the ][  ][ materials I had collected, resolving to finis ][ h my labours in some ][  ][ obscure nook in the northern
 highlands of Scotland. ][  ][ We quitted London on the 27th of March an ][ d remained a few days at ][  ][ Windsor, rambling in
 its beautiful forest.  This was a new scene to us ][  ][ mountaineers; the  ][ majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the her
ds of ][  ][ stately deer were all novelties to us. ][  ][ From thence we procee ][ ded to Oxford.  As we entered this city our 
minds ][  ][ were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted ][  ][  ][ there more than a century and a 
half before.  It was here that Charles ][  ][ I. had collected his forces.  This city ha ][ d remained faithful to him, ][  ][ a
fter the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of ][  ][ Parliament and l ][ iberty.  The memory of that unfo
rtunate king and his ][  ][ companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, an ][ d ][  ][ son, gave a peculia
r interest to every part of the city which they ][  ][ might be supposed to have inhabited.  The spi ][ rit of elder days found 
a ][  ][ dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.  If these ][  ][ feelings had not found ][  an imaginary gratif
ication, the appearance of ][  ][ the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. ][  ][  ][ The colleges
 are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost ][  ][ magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside ][  it through 
meadows ][  ][ of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, ][  ][ which reflects its maje ][ stic ass
emblage of towers, and spires, and ][  ][ domes, embosomed among aged trees. ][  ][ I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enj ][ oyme
nt was embittered both by the ][  ][ memory of the past and the anticipation of the future.  I was formed ][  ][ for peacefu ][ 
l happiness.  During my youthful days discontent never ][  ][ visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of
 ][  what ][  ][ is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in ][  ][ the productions of man could alw
ays  ][ interest my heart and communicate ][  ][ elasticity to my spirits.  But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has ][  ][ entered
 my soul ][ ; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what ][  ][ I shall soon cease to be--a miserable spectacle of wr
ecked humani ][ ty, ][  ][ pitiable to others and intolerable to myself. ][  ][ We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambl
ing among its en ][ virons ][  ][ and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most ][  ][ animating epoch 
of English history.  ][  Our little voyages of discovery ][  ][ were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented ][
  ][ themselves.  We vis ][ ited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the ][  ][ field on which that patriot fell.  For a mom
ent my soul was elevated ][  ][  ][ from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas ][  ][ of liberty and 
self sacrifice of which these si ][ ghts were the monuments ][  ][ and the remembrancers.  For an instant I dared to shake off m
y chains ][  ][ and look around me w ][ ith a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten ][  ][ into my flesh, and I sank aga
in, trembling and hopeless, into my ][   ][ ][ miserable self. ][  ][ We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which
 was our next ][  ][ place of rest.  The cou ][ ntry in the neighbourhood of this village ][  ][ resembled, to a greater degree,
 the scenery of Switzerland; but ][  ][ everythi ][ ng is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of ][  ][ distant
 white Alps which always attend on the piny mountain ][ s of my ][  ][ native country.  We visited the wondrous cave and the lit
tle cabinets ][  ][ of natural history, where the curios ][ ities are disposed in the same ][  ][ manner as in the collections a
t Servox and Chamounix.  The latter name ][  ][ made me trem ][ ble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit ][  ][ Matl
ock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated. ][  ][  ][ From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two month
s in ][  ][ Cumberland and Westmorland.  I could now almost fancy my ][ self among the ][  ][ Swiss mountains.  The little patch
es of snow which yet lingered on the ][  ][ northern sides of the mounta ][ ins, the lakes, and the dashing of the ][  ][ rocky 
streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.  Here also we ][  ][ made s ][ ome acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat
 me into ][  ][ happiness.  The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater th ][ an ][  ][ mine; his mind expanded in the com
pany of men of talent, and he found ][  ][ in his own nature greater capacities and  ][ resources than he could have ][  ][ imag
ined himself to have possessed while he associated with his ][  ][ inferiors.  "I could  ][ pass my life here," said he to me; "
and among ][  ][ these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine." ][  ][ ][  But he found that a traveller's
 life is one that includes much pain ][  ][ amidst its enjoyments.  His feelings are forever on  ][ the stretch; and ][  ][ when
 he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit ][  ][ that on which he rests in pl ][ easure for something new
, which again ][  ][ engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties. ][  ][ We ha ][ d scarcely visited t
he various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland ][  ][ and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants ][  when the period
 ][  ][ of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them ][  ][ to travel on.  For my own  ][ part I was n
ot sorry.  I had now neglected my ][  ][ promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the daemon's ][  ][ disa ][ ppointme
nt.  He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance ][  ][ on my relatives.  This idea pursued me and tormented  ][ me a
t every moment ][  ][ from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.  I waited ][  ][ for my letters with feve ][ 
rish impatience; if they were delayed I was ][  ][ miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I ][  ]
 ][ [ saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to ][  ][ read and ascertain my fate.  Sometimes I though
t th ][ at the fiend ][  ][ followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. ][  ][ When these thoughts p
ossessed ][  me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, ][  ][ but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rag
e of ][  ][  ][ his destroyer.  I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the ][  ][ consciousness of which haunted me.  I 
was guiltless, b ][ ut I had indeed ][  ][ drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime. ][  ][ I visite
d Edinburgh with lan ][ guid eyes and mind; and yet that city might ][  ][ have interested the most unfortunate being.  Clerval 
did not like it so ][  ] ][ [ well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing ][  ][ to him.  But the bea
uty and regularity of the ne ][ w town of Edinburgh, ][  ][ its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the wor
ld, ][  ][ Arthur's Seat, St. Be ][ rnard's Well, and the Pentland Hills compensated ][  ][ him for the change and filled him wi
th cheerfulness and admiration. But  ][ ][  ][ I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey. ][  ][ We left Edinbu
rgh in a week, passing through Coupar, S ][ t. Andrew's, and ][  ][ along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expec
ted us. ][  ][ But I was in no mood to laugh ][  and talk with strangers or enter into ][  ][ their feelings or plans with the g
ood humour expected from a guest; and ][  ][ acc ][ ordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland ][  ][ al
one.  "Do you," said I, "enjoy yourself, and let thi ][ s be our ][  ][ rendezvous.  I may be absent a month or two; but do not 
interfere with ][  ][ my motions, I entreat you; leave m ][ e to peace and solitude for a short ][  ][ time; and when I return, 
I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more ][  ][ congenia ][ l to your own temper." ][  ][ Henry wished to dissuade me, but s
eeing me bent on this plan, ceased to ][  ][ remonstrate.  He en ][ treated me to write often.  "I had rather be with ][  ][ you
," he said, "in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch ][  ][ ][  people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear  frie
nd, to return, ][  ][ that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, whi ][ ch I cannot do in ][  ][ your absence." ][  ][ Havin
g parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of ][  ][ Sc ][ otland and finish my work in solitude.  I did no
t doubt but that the ][  ][ monster followed me and would discover himself to me ][  when I should have ][  ][ finished, that he
 might receive his companion.  With this resolution I ][  ][ traversed the northern  ][ highlands and fixed on one of the remote
st of ][  ][ the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.  It was a place fitted for such ][  ][  ][ a work, being hardly more than a
 rock whose high sides were continually ][  ][ beaten upon by the waves.  The soil was barre ][ n, scarcely affording ][  ][ pas
ture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, ][  ][ which consisted of five p ][ ersons, whose gaunt and scra
ggy limbs gave ][  ][ tokens of their miserable fare.  Vegetables and bread, when they ][  ][ indulg ][ ed in such luxuries, and
 even fresh water, was to be procured ][  ][ from the mainland, which was about five miles distant. ][   ][ ][ On the whole isla
nd there were but three miserable huts, and one of ][  ][ these was vacant when I arrived.  This I hired.  I ][ t contained but 
two ][  ][ rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable ][  ][ penury.  The thatch had f ][ allen in, th
e walls were unplastered, and the ][  ][ door was off its hinges.  I ordered it to be repaired, bought some ][  ][ f ][ urniture
, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have ][  ][ occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of  ][ the 
cottagers been ][  ][ benumbed by want and squalid poverty.  As it was, I lived ungazed at ][  ][ and unmolested, hardly tha ][ 
nked for the pittance of food and clothes ][  ][ which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations ][  ][ 
 ][ of men. ][  ][ In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, ][  ][ when the weather permitted, I wal
ked  ][ on the stony beach of the sea to ][  ][ listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.  It was a ][  ][ monot
onous ye ][ t ever-changing scene.  I thought of Switzerland; it was ][  ][ far different from this desolate and appalling lands
cape.  Its h ][ ills ][  ][ are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the ][  ][ plains.  Its fair lakes
 reflect a blue  ][ and gentle sky, and when ][  ][ troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively ][  ][ in
fant when compared t ][ o the roarings of the giant ocean. ][  ][ In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arriv
ed, but ][  ][ as I proc ][ eeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and ][  ][ irksome to me.  Sometimes I could n
ot prevail on myself to ente ][ r my ][  ][ laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night ][  ][ in ord
er to complete my work.  It was, ][  indeed, a filthy process in ][  ][ which I was engaged.  During my first experiment, a kind
 of ][  ][ enthusiastic frenzy had b ][ linded me to the horror of my employment; my ][  ][ mind was intently fixed on the consu
mmation of my labour, and my eyes ][  ][ ][  were shut to the horror of my proceedings.  But now I went to it in ][  ][ cold blo
od, and my heart often sickened at the work  ][ of my hands. ][  ][ Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, i
mmersed in ][  ][ a solitude where nothing could ][  for an instant call my attention from ][  ][ the actual scene in which I wa
s engaged, my spirits became unequal; I ][  ][ grew  ][ restless and nervous.  Every moment I feared to meet my ][  ][ persecuto
r.  Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fe ][ aring ][  ][ to raise them lest they should encounter the object whi
ch I so much ][  ][ dreaded to behold.  I feared to wander f ][ rom the sight of my fellow ][  ][ creatures lest when alone he s
hould come to claim his companion. ][  ][ In the mean time I wor ][ ked on, and my labour was already considerably ][  ][ advanc
ed.  I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager ][   ][ ][ hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but 
which was ][  ][ intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made m ][ y heart sicken ][  ][ in my bosom. ][  ][ Chapter 20
 ][  ][ I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon wa ][ s ][  ][ just rising from the sea; I had not suf
ficient light for my employment, ][  ][ and I remained idle, in a pause of consi ][ deration of whether I should ][  ][ leave my
 labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an ][  ][ unremitting attention to ][  it.  As I sat, a train of reflection oc
curred ][  ][ to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. ][  ][ ][  Three years before, I was engaged i
n the same manner and had created a ][  ][ fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated  ][ my heart and filled it ][  ][ fo
rever with the bitterest remorse.  I was now about to form another ][  ][ being of whose disposi ][ tions I was alike ignorant; 
she might become ten ][  ][ thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own ][  ][  ][ sake, in murder and 
wretchedness.  He had sworn to quit the ][  ][ neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she ][  had not; and ][  ][
 she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning ][  ][ animal, might refuse to comply wi ][ th a compact mad
e before her creation. ][  ][ They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed ][  ][ his ][  own deformi
ty, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for ][  ][ it when it came before his eyes in the female form?  S ][ he also 
might ][  ][ turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might ][  ][ quit him, and he be again alone, ][  exa
sperated by the fresh provocation ][  ][ of being deserted by one of his own species.  Even if they were to ][  ][ leave Eur ][ 
ope and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the ][  ][ first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirs
 ][ ted would ][  ][ be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth ][  ][ who might make the very existen
ce o ][ f the species of man a condition ][  ][ precarious and full of terror.  Had I right, for my own benefit, to ][  ][ infli
ct this  ][ curse upon everlasting generations?  I had before been ][  ][ moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I ha
d been struc ][ k ][  ][ senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the ][  ][ wickedness of my promise bur
st upon me; I sh ][ uddered to think that ][  ][ future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not ][  ][ hesi
tated to buy its own ][  peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence ][  ][ of the whole human race. ][  ][ I trembled and my 
heart failed within me,  ][ when, on looking up, I saw by ][  ][ the light of the moon the daemon at the casement.  A ghastly gr
in ][  ][ wrinkled his lips  ][ as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task ][  ][ which he had allotted to me.  Yes, he 
had followed me in my travels; h ][ e ][  ][ had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide ][  ][ and d
esert heaths; and he now came to mar ][ k my progress and claim the ][  ][ fulfilment of my promise. ][  ][ As I looked on him, 
his countenance expressed the utmost ext ][ ent of ][  ][ malice and treachery.  I thought with a sensation of madness on my ][ 
 ][ promise of creating another like to him, ][  and trembling with passion, ][  ][ tore to pieces the thing on which I was enga
ged.  The wretch saw me ][  ][ destroy the creat ][ ure on whose future existence he depended for ][  ][ happiness, and with a h
owl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew. ][  ] ][ [ I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own ][ 
 ][ heart never to resume my labours; and then, with tre ][ mbling steps, I ][  ][ sought my own apartment. I was alone; none we
re near me to dissipate ][  ][ the gloom and relieve me from ][  the sickening oppression of the most ][  ][ terrible reveries. 
][  ][ Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazin ][ g on the sea; ][  ][ it was almost motionless, for the winds
 were hushed, and all nature ][  ][ reposed under the eye of the qui ][ et moon.  A few fishing vessels alone ][  ][ specked the
 water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound ][  ][ of vo ][ ices as the fishermen called to one another.  I felt
 the silence, ][  ][ although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundi ][ ty, until my ear ][  ][ was suddenly arrested by
 the paddling of oars near the shore, and a ][  ][ person landed close to my hou ][ se. ][  ][ In a few minutes after, I heard t
he creaking of my door, as if some one ][  ][ endeavoured to open it softly.  I trem ][ bled from head to foot; I felt a ][  ][ 
presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who ][  ][ dwelt in a ][  cottage not far from mine; but I wa
s overcome by the ][  ][ sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when  ][ you ][  ][ in vain endeavour to 
fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to ][  ][ the spot. Presently I heard the sound of  ][ footsteps along the passage;
 ][  ][ the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. ][  ][ Shutting the door, he approa ][ ched me and said in a sm
othered voice, "You ][  ][ have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend? ][  ][ D ][ o you dare to break 
your promise?  I have endured toil and misery; I ][  ][ left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores  ][ of the Rhine, am
ong ][  ][ its willow islands and over the summits of its hills.  I have dwelt ][  ][ many months in the heaths  ][ of England a
nd among the deserts of Scotland. ][  ][ I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare ][   ][ ][ destr
oy my hopes?" ][  ][ "Begone!  I do break my promise; never will I create another like ][  ][ yourself, equal in deformi ][ ty a
nd wickedness." ][  ][ "Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself ][  ][ unworthy of my condescension. ][ 
  Remember that I have power; you believe ][  ][ yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of ][  ][ day
 ][  will be hateful to you.  You are my creator, but I am your master; ][  ][ obey!" ][  ][ "The hour of my irresolution is pas
t, a ][ nd the period of your power is ][  ][ arrived.  Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but ][  ][ they 
confirm  ][ me in a determination of not creating you a companion in ][  ][ vice.  Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the ea
rth a daemon ][  whose ][  ][ delight is in death and wretchedness?  Begone!  I am firm, and your ][  ][ words will only exasper
ate my rage." ][ ][   ][ The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in ][  ][ the impotence of anger.  "S
hall each man," crie ][ d he, "find a wife for ][  ][ his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?  I had ][  ][ fee
lings of affection, and  ][ they were requited by detestation and scorn. ][  ][ Man!  You may hate, but beware!  Your hours will
 pass in dread and ][  ][ mi ][ sery, and soon the bolt  will fall which must ravish from you your ][  ][ happiness forever.  Ar
e you to be happy while I grovel ][  in the intensity ][  ][ of my wretchedness?  You can blast my other passions, but revenge ]
[  ][ remains--revenge, henceforth d ][ earer than light or food!  I may die, but ][  ][ first you, my tyrant and tormentor, sha
ll curse the sun that gazes on ][  ][ yo ][ ur misery.  Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.  I will ][  ][ watch w
ith the wiliness of a snake, that I may stin ][ g with its venom. ][  ][ Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict." ][ 
 ][ "Devil, cease; and do not poison the air wit ][ h these sounds of malice. ][  ][ I have declared my resolution to you, and I
 am no coward to bend ][  ][ beneath words.  Leave m ][ e; I am inexorable." ][  ][ "It is well.  I go; but remember, I shall be
 with you on your ][  ][ wedding-night." ][  ][ I starte ][ d forward and exclaimed, "Villain!  Before you sign my ][  ][ death-
warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe." ][  ][ I would ][  have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with ][
  ][ precipitation.  In a few moments I saw him in his boat, whi ][ ch shot ][  ][ across the waters with an arrowy swiftness an
d was soon lost amidst the ][  ][ waves. ][  ][ All was again silent ][ , but his words rang in my ears.  I burned with ][  ][ r
age to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ][   ][ ][ ocean.  I walked up and down my room hastily and 
perturbed, while my ][  ][ imagination conjured up a thousand images to torm ][ ent and sting me.  Why ][  ][ had I not followed
 him and closed with him in mortal strife?  But I had ][  ][ suffered him to dep ][ art, and he had directed his course towards 
the ][  ][ mainland.  I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed ] ][ [  ][ to his insatiate revenge.  And the
n I thought again of his words--"I ][  ][ WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT."  That ][ , then, was the period ][  ][ fixed 
for the fulfilment of my destiny.  In that hour I should die and ][  ][ at once satisfy and  ][ extinguish his malice.  The pros
pect did not move ][  ][ me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears ][ ][   ][ and endless sorrow, whe
n she should find her lover so barbarously ][  ][ snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for ][  many months, ][  ][ str
eamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy ][  ][ without a bitter struggle. ][  ][  ][ The night passed awa
y, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings ][  ][ became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the  ][ violence of rage
 ][  ][ sinks into the depths of despair.  I left the house, the horrid scene ][  ][ of the last night's content ][ ion, and wal
ked on the beach of the sea, ][  ][ which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my ][  ][ fello ][ w creatu
res; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole ][  ][ across me. ][  ][ I desired that I might pass my life on t ][ hat 
barren rock, wearily, it is ][  ][ true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery.  If I returned, ][  ][ it was to b ][ 
e sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the ][  ][ grasp of a daemon whom I had myself created. ][  ][ I walked
 ][  about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it ][  ][ loved and miserable in the separation.  When it became
 noo ][ n, and the ][  ][ sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep ][  ][ sleep.  I had been awake
 the who ][ le of the preceding night, my nerves ][  ][ were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.  The sleep ]
[  ][ into w ][ hich I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as ][  ][ if I belonged to a race of human beings l
ike myself, and  ][ I began to ][  ][ reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the ][  ][ words of the fie
nd rang in my ears l ][ ike a death-knell; they appeared ][  ][ like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality. ][  ][ T
he sun had far descended ][ , and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my ][  ][ appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oa
ten cake, when I saw a ][  ] ][ [ fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; ][  ][ it contained let
ters from Geneva, and one from C ][ lerval entreating me to ][  ][ join him.  He said that he was wearing away his time fruitles
sly where ][  ][ he was, that letter ][ s from the friends he had formed in London desired ][  ][ his return to complete the neg
otiation they had entered into for his ] ][ [  ][ Indian enterprise.  He could not any longer delay his departure; but as ][  ][
 his journey to London might be followed, ev ][ en sooner than he now ][  ][ conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me 
to bestow as much of ][  ][ my society on him as ][  I could spare.  He besought me, therefore, to ][  ][ leave my solitary isle
 and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed ][  ][  ][ southwards together.  This letter in a degree recalled me to life, a
nd ][  ][ I determined to quit my island at the expirati ][ on of two days.  Yet, ][  ][ before I departed, there was a task to 
perform, on which I shuddered to ][  ][ reflect; I must pack ][  up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I ][  ][ must 
enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I ][  ][  ][ must handle those utensils the sight of which was si
ckening to me. The ][  ][ next morning, at daybreak, I summoned suff ][ icient courage and unlocked ][  ][ the door of my labora
tory.  The remains of the half-finished creature, ][  ][ whom I had dest ][ royed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt
 as ][  ][ if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being.  I paused to  ][ ][  ][ collect myself and then entered the chamb
er.  With trembling hand I ][  ][ conveyed the instruments out of the room, but  ][ I reflected that I ought ][  ][ not to leave
 the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion ][  ][ of the peasants; an ][ d I accordingly put them into a basket, 
with a great ][  ][ quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them int ][ o ][  ][ the sea that very night; an
d in the meantime I sat upon the beach, ][  ][ employed in cleaning and arranging my chemica ][ l apparatus. ][  ][ Nothing coul
d be more complete than the alteration that had taken place ][  ][ in my feelings since the nigh ][ t of the appearance of the d
aemon.  I had ][  ][ before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with ][  ][ w ][ hatever consequences, mu
st be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film ][  ][ had been taken from before my eyes and that I for th ][ e first time saw ][ 
 ][ clearly.  The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur ][  ][ to me; the threat I had h ][ eard weighed on 
my thoughts, but I did not ][  ][ reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.  I had resolved in ][  ][ ][  my own mind
 that to create another like the fiend I had first made ][  ][ would be an act of the basest and most atrocious self ][ ishness,
 and I ][  ][ banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different ][  ][ conclusion. ][  ][ Between two a ][ nd t
hree in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting ][  ][ my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles f ][ 
rom the ][  ][ shore.  The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning ][  ][ towards land, but I sailed away from 
 ][ them.  I felt as if I was about ][  ][ the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety ][  ][ any enc
ount ][ er with my fellow creatures.  At one time the moon, which ][  ][ had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thi
ck cloud ][ , and I ][  ][ took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the ][  ][ sea; I listened to the gu
rgling sound ][  as it sank and then sailed away ][  ][ from the spot.  The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although ]
[  ][ chilled by ][  the northeast breeze that was then rising.  But it refreshed ][  ][ me and filled me with such agreeable se
nsations that I reso ][ lved to ][  ][ prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct ][  ][ position, stretche
d myself at the bottom o ][ f the boat.  Clouds hid the ][  ][ moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the b
oat as ][  ][ its keel cut t ][ hrough the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short ][  ][ time I slept soundly. I do not kno
w how long I remained in this ][ ][   ][ situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted ][  ][ considerabl
y.  The wind was high, and the waves ][  continually threatened ][  ][ the safety of my little skiff.  I found that the wind was
 northeast and ][  ][ must have driven m ][ e far from the coast from which I had embarked.  I ][  ][ endeavoured to change my c
ourse but quickly found that if I again made ][  ][  ][ the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water.  Thus ][  ][ 
situated, my only resource was to drive before t ][ he wind.  I confess ][  ][ that I felt a few sensations of terror.  I had no
 compass with me and ][  ][ was so slenderly acquain ][ ted with the geography of this part of the ][  ][ world that the sun was
 of little benefit to me.  I might be driven into ][  ][ ][  the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be ][ 
 ][ swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and  ][ buffeted around ][  ][ me.  I had already been out many hours an
d felt the torment of a ][  ][ burning thirst, a prelude to my o ][ ther sufferings.  I looked on the ][  ][ heavens, which were
 covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only ][  ][ to be repl ][ aced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my g
rave. ][  ][ "Fiend," I exclaimed, "your task is already fulfilled!"  I  ][ thought of ][  ][ Elizabeth, of my father, and of Cl
erval--all left behind, on whom the ][  ][ monster might satisfy his sanguin ][ ary and merciless passions.  This idea ][  ][ pl
unged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, ][  ][ when t ][ he scene is on the point of closing before m
e forever, I shudder ][  ][ to reflect on it. ][  ][ Some hours passed thus; but by  ][ degrees, as the sun declined towards the
 ][  ][ horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became ][  ][ free  ][ from breakers.  But these gave place
 to a heavy swell; I felt sick ][  ][ and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I sa ][ w a line of high ][  ][ land tow
ards the south. ][  ][ Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured ][ ][   ][ for several hours, this
 sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of ][  ][ warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from  ][ my eyes. ][  ][ How muta
ble are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we ][  ][ have of life even in the excess of ][  misery!  I construc
ted another sail ][  ][ with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. ][  ][ It ha ][ d a wild and roc
ky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily ][  ][ perceived the traces of cultivation.  I saw vessels ne ][ ar the shore
 and ][  ][ found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of ][  ][ civilized man.  I carefully traced ][  the win
dings of the land and hailed ][  ][ a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. ][  ][ As I  ][ was 
in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly ][  ][ towards the town, as a place where I could most easily pr ][ 
ocure ][  ][ nourishment.  Fortunately I had money with me. ][  ][ As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and 
 ][ a good ][  ][ harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected ][  ][ escape. ][  ][ As I was occupied 
in f ][ ixing the boat and arranging the sails, several ][  ][ people crowded towards the spot.  They seemed much surprised at m
y ][  ][ ][  appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered ][  ][ together with gestures that at any other ti
me might hav ][ e produced in me ][  ][ a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they ][  ][ spoke English
, and I therefor ][ e addressed them in that language.  "My ][  ][ good friends," said I, "will you be so kind as to tell me the
 name of ][  ][ this ][  town and inform me where I am?" ][  ][ "You will know that soon enough," replied a man with a hoarse vo
ice. ][  ][ "Maybe you a ][ re come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, ][  ][ but you will not be consulted as t
o your quarters, I promise y ][ ou." ][  ][ I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a ][  ][ stranger, a
nd I was also disconcerted on pe ][ rceiving the frowning and ][  ][ angry countenances of his companions.  "Why do you answer m
e so ][  ][ roughly?"  I replied.  " ][ Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to ][  ][ receive strangers so inhospitably." 
][  ][ "I do not know," said the man, "w ][ hat the custom of the English may be, ][  ][ but it is the custom of the Irish to ha
te villains." While this strange ][  ][ dial ][ ogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase.  Their ][  ][ faces expr
essed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which an ][ noyed  and in ][  ][ some degree alarmed me. ][  ][ I inquired the way to th
e inn, but no one replied.  I then moved ][  ][ forw ][ ard, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed ][  ][ 
and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching t ][ apped me on the ][  ][ shoulder and said, "Come, sir, you must follo
w me to Mr. Kirwin's to ][  ][ give an account of yourself." ][  ][  ][ "Who is Mr. Kirwin?  Why am I to give an account of myse
lf?  Is not ][  ][ this a free country?" ][  ][ "Ay, sir, free e ][ nough for honest folks.  Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, ][  ][ 
and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was ] ][ [  ][ found murdered here last night." ][  ][ This answe
r startled me, but I presently recovered myself.  I was ][  ][ innocent; ][  that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed
 my ][  ][ conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the ][  town. ][  ][ I was ready to sink from fatigue a
nd hunger, but being surrounded by a ][  ][ crowd, I thought it politic to rouse ][  all my strength, that no physical ][  ][ de
bility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. ][  ][ Little did I  ][ then expect the calamity that was in a f
ew moments to ][  ][ overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignom ][ iny ][  ][ or death. I must pause he
re, for it requires all my fortitude to recall ][  ][ the memory of the frightful events whi ][ ch I am about to relate, in ][  
][ proper detail, to my recollection. ][  ][ Chapter 21 ][  ][ I was soon introduced into the pr ][ esence of the magistrate, an
 old ][  ][ benevolent man with calm and mild manners.  He looked upon me, however, ][  ][ with some ][  degree of severity, and
 then, turning towards my conductors, ][  ][ he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion. ][  ][ ][  About half a dozen 
men came forward; and, one being selected by the ][  ][ magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing  ][ the night before
 ][  ][ with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten ][  ][ o'clock, they observed a strong n ][ ortherly bla
st rising, and they ][  ][ accordingly put in for port.  It was a very dark night, as the moon had ][  ][ not yet ri ][ sen; the
y did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been ][  ][ accustomed, at a creek about two miles below.  He walked on  ][ firs
t, ][  ][ carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him ][  ][ at some distance. ][  ][ As he was p ][ 
roceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against ][  ][ something and fell at his length on the ground. His companions came
 ][  up ][  ][ to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had ][  ][ fallen on the body of a man, who w
as t ][ o all appearance dead.  Their ][  ][ first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had ][  ][ been dro
wned and ][  was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination ][  ][ they found that the clothes were not wet and even that 
the body was ][  not ][  ][ then cold.  They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman ][  ][ near the spot and endeav
oured, but in va ][ in, to restore it to life.  It ][  ][ appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of ][
  ][ age.  He had ap ][ parently been strangled, for there was no sign of any ][  ][ violence except the black mark of fingers o
n his neck. ][  ][ The f ][ irst part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but ][  ][ when the mark of the finge
rs was mentioned I remembere ][ d the murder of ][  ][ my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a ]
[  ][ mist came over my eyes, wh ][ ich obliged me to lean on a chair for ][  ][ support.  The magistrate observed me with a kee
n eye and of course drew ][  ][ an u ][ nfavourable augury from my manner. ][  ][ The son confirmed his father's account, but wh
en Daniel Nugent was ][  ][ called he sw ][ ore positively that just before the fall of his companion, ][  ][ he saw a boat, wit
h a single man in it, at a short distance fr ][ om the ][  ][ shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, i
t was ][  ][ the same boat in which I had just l ][ anded.  A woman deposed that she ][  ][ lived near the beach and was standin
g at the door of her cottage, ][  ][ waiting for the ][  return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard ][  ][ of the d
iscovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one  ][ man in ][  ][ it push off from that part of the shore where the corp
se was afterwards ][  ][ found. ][  ][ Another woman confirm ][ ed the account of the fishermen having brought the ][  ][ body i
nto her house; it was not cold.  They put it into a bed and ][   ][ ][ rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary,
 but life was ][  ][ quite gone. ][  ][ Several other men were exami ][ ned concerning my landing, and they agreed ][  ][ that, 
with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it ][  ][ w ][ as very probable that I had beaten about for many ho
urs and had been ][  ][ obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which ][  I had departed. ][  ][ Besides, they observed t
hat it appeared that I had brought the body ][  ][ from another place, and it wa ][ s likely that as I did not appear to know ][
  ][ the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance ][  ][ of ][  the town of ---- from the place where I
 had deposited the corpse. ][  ][ Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I s ][ hould be taken ][  ][ into the room 
where the body lay for interment, that it might be ][  ][ observed what effect the sight of  ][ it would produce upon me.  This 
idea ][  ][ was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when ][  ][ the mode ][  of the murder had been desc
ribed.  I was accordingly ][  ][ conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn. ][   I ][  ][ could not hel
p being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken ][  ][ place during this eventful night; but,  ][ knowing that I had b
een ][  ][ conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the ][  ][ time that the body ][  had been found,
 I was perfectly tranquil as to the ][  ][ consequences of the affair.  I entered the room where the corpse lay  ][ ][  ][ and w
as led up to the coffin.  How can I describe my sensations on ][  ][ beholding it?  I feel yet parched with horror,  ][ nor can 
I reflect on ][  ][ that terrible moment without shuddering and agony.  The examination, ][  ][ the presence of the magi ][ stra
te and witnesses, passed like a dream from ][  ][ my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched ][  ][ b ][ 
efore me.  I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I ][  ][ exclaimed, "Have my murderous machinations deprived yo
 ][ u also, my ][  ][ dearest Henry, of life?  Two I have already destroyed; other victims ][  ][ await their destiny; but you, 
Cler ][ val, my friend, my benefactor--" ][  ][ The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and ][  ][ I
 was car ][ ried out of the room in strong convulsions.  A fever succeeded ][  ][ to this.  I lay for two months on the point of
 death; my r ][ avings, as I ][  ][ afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of ][  ][ William, of Justine
, and of Clerval ][ .  Sometimes I entreated my ][  ][ attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was ][ 
 ][ tormented; and a ][ t others I felt the fingers of the monster already ][  ][ grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agon
y and terror. ][  ][ For ][ tunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood ][  ][ me; but my gestures and 
bitter cries were sufficient ][  to affright the ][  ][ other witnesses.  Why did I not die?  More miserable than man ever was ]
[  ][ before, why did I not sink ][  into forgetfulness and rest?  Death snatches ][  ][ away many blooming children, the only h
opes of their doting parents; ][  ][ ][  how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of ][  ][ health and
 hope, and the next a prey for worms and ][  the decay of the ][  ][ tomb!  Of what materials was I made that I could thus resis
t so many ][  ][ shocks, which, like the tur ][ ning of the wheel, continually renewed the ][  ][ torture? ][  ][ But I was doom
ed to live and in two months found myself as awa ][ king from ][  ][ a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surround
ed by ][  ][ jailers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the m ][ iserable apparatus of a dungeon. ][  ][ It was morning, I remember, when
 I thus awoke to understanding; I had ][  ][ forgotten t ][ he particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some ][  ][ 
great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I loo ][ ked around ][  ][ and saw the barred windows and the squalidness
 of the room in which I ][  ][ was, all flashed across my memory ][  and I groaned bitterly. ][  ][ This sound disturbed an old 
woman who was sleeping in a chair beside ][  ][ me.  She was a hired ][  nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her ][  ][ 
countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterize ] ][ [  ][ that class.  The lines of her face were hard a
nd rude, like that of ][  ][ persons accustomed to see without sympathizing  ][ in sights of misery. Her ][  ][ tone expressed h
er entire indifference; she addressed me in English, ][  ][ and the voice struck ][  me as one that I had heard during my suffer
ings. ][  ][ "Are you better now, sir?" said she. ][  ][ I replied in the same langu ][ age, with a feeble voice, "I believe I a
m; ][  ][ but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am ][  ][  ][ still alive to feel this misery and 
horror." ][  ][ "For that matter," replied the old woman, "if you mean about the ][  ][ gent ][ leman you murdered, I believe th
at it were better for you if you ][  ][ were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!  Howeve ][ r, that's none ][  ][ of my 
business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty ][  ][ with a safe conscience; it we ][ re well if everybody did
 the same." ][  ][ I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a ][  ][ speech to ][  a person just saved
, on the very edge of death; but I felt ][  ][ languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.  The wh ][ ole series ][  ]
[ of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it ][  ][ were all true, for it never pres ][ ented itself
 to my mind with the force ][  ][ of reality. ][  ][ As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I gr ][ ew ][  ]
[ feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed ][  ][ me with the gentle voice of love; no dea ][ r ha
nd supported me.  The ][  ][ physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared ][  ][ them for me; but utt ][ 
er carelessness was visible in the first, and the ][  ][ expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the ][  ][
 ][  second.  Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the ][  ][ hangman who would gain his fee? ][  ][ These were
 my  ][ first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had ][  ][ shown me extreme kindness.  He had caused the best room
 in the  ][ prison ][  ][ to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who ][  ][ had provided a physicia
n and a nurs ][ e.  It is true, he seldom came to ][  ][ see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of ]
[  ][ every huma ][ n creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and ][  ][ miserable ravings of a murderer.  He cam
e, therefore, someti ][ mes to see ][  ][ that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long ][  ][ intervals.  O
ne day, while I was grad ][ ually recovering, I was seated in ][  ][ a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those i
n death.  I ][  ][ was overc ][ ome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek ][  ][ death than desire to remain
 in a world which to me was repl ][ ete with ][  ][ wretchedness.  At one time I considered whether I should not declare ][  ][ 
myself guilty and suffer the penalty ][  of the law, less innocent than ][  ][ poor Justine had been.  Such were my thoughts whe
n the door of my ][  ][ apartment was op ][ ened and Mr. Kirwin entered.  His countenance expressed ][  ][ sympathy and compassi
on; he drew a chair close to mine and addres ][ sed me ][  ][ in French, "I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I 
do ][  ][ anything to make you more comfortable? ][ " ][  ][ "I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the who
le ][  ][ earth there is no comfort which I am capab ][ le of receiving." ][  ][ "I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be 
but of little relief to ][  ][ one borne down as you are ][  by so strange a misfortune.  But you will, I ][  ][ hope, soon quit
 this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can ][  ][ ea ][ sily be brought to free you from the criminal charge." ][  ][ "T
hat is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, be ][ come ][  ][ the most miserable of mortals.  Persecuted and t
ortured as I am and ][  ][ have been, can death be any evil to me?"  ][ ][  ][ "Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and ago
nizing than the ][  ][ strange chances that have lately occurred.  You w ][ ere thrown, by some ][  ][ surprising accident, on t
his shore, renowned for its hospitality, ][  ][ seized immediately, and char ][ ged with murder.  The first sight that was ][  ]
[ presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so ][  ][ unac ][ countable a manner and placed, as it were, b
y some fiend across ][  ][ your path." ][  ][ As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstandi ][ ng the agitation I endured on ][  ][ thi
s retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at ][  ][ the knowledge ][  he seemed to possess concerning me.
  I suppose some ][  ][ astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastene ][ d ][  ][ to say, "Immediately up
on your being taken ill, all the papers that ][  ][ were on your person were brought me, and I e ][ xamined them that I might ][
  ][ discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account ][  ][ of your misfortun ][ e and illness. I found s
everal letters, and, among ][  ][ others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your ] ][ [  ][ father.  I ins
tantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed ][  ][ since the departure of my letter.  But you are ][  ill; even now y
ou ][  ][ tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind." ][  ][ "This suspense is a thousand times worse tha ][ n the most h
orrible event; ][  ][ tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am ][  ][ now to lament?" ] ][ [  ][ "Y
our family is perfectly well," said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; "and ][  ][ someone, a friend, is come to visit you." ][ ][   ][
 I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it ][  ][ instantly darted into my mind that the murdere ][ 
r had come to mock at my ][  ][ misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for ][  ][ me to comply with 
 ][ his hellish desires.  I put my hand before my eyes, ][  ][ and cried out in agony, "Oh! Take him away!  I cannot see him; fo
r ][ ][   ][ God's sake, do not let him enter!" ][  ][ Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.  He could not help ][
  ][ reg ][ arding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in ][  ][ rather a severe tone, "I should have thought, 
young man, t ][ hat the ][  ][ presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring ][  ][ such violent repugnan
ce." ][  ][ "My  ][ father!" cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed ][  ][ from anguish to pleasure.  "Is my 
father indeed come?  ][  How kind, how ][  ][ very kind!  But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?" ][  ][ My change of ma
nner surprised and pleas ][ ed the magistrate; perhaps he ][  ][ thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of de
lirium, ][  ][ and now he in ][ stantly resumed his former benevolence.  He rose and ][  ][ quitted the room with my nurse, and 
in a moment my father entered it ][ . ][  ][ Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the ][  ][ arriv
al of my father.  I stretched out my ][  hand to him and cried, "Are ][  ][ you, then, safe--and Elizabeth--and Ernest?" My fath
er calmed me with ][  ][ assurances of t ][ heir welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these ][  ][ subjects so interesting to
 my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; ] ][ [  ][ but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness. ][  ][
 "What a place is this that you inhabit, my son! ][ " said he, looking ][  ][ mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appe
arance of the room. ][  ][ "You travelled to seek ha ][ ppiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. ][  ][ And poor Clerval--" 
][  ][ The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend wa ][ s an agitation too ][  ][ great to be endured in my weak state; I sh
ed tears.  "Alas!  Yes, my ][  ][ father," replied I; "some  ][ destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over ][  ][ me, and I mu
st live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the ][  ][ ][  coffin of Henry." ][  ][ We were not allowed to converse fo
r any length of time, for the ][  ][ precarious state of my health r ][ endered every precaution necessary that ][  ][ could ens
ure tranquillity.  Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my ][  ][ streng ][ th should not be exhausted by too much exertion.  Bu
t the ][  ][ appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, a ][ nd I ][  ][ gradually recovered my health. ][  ]
[ As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black ][  ][ melanch ][ oly that nothing could dissipate.  The image
 of Clerval was ][  ][ forever before me, ghastly and murdered.  More than once the  ][ agitation ][  ][ into which these reflec
tions threw me made my friends dread a dangerous ][  ][ relapse.  Alas!  Why did they pr ][ eserve so miserable and detested a ]
[  ][ life?  It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now ][  ][ drawing to a  ][ close.  Soon, oh, very soon, wil
l death extinguish these ][  ][ throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that ][  bears ][  ][ me to the dust
; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also ][  ][ sink to rest.  Then the appearance of  ][ death was distant, altho
ugh the ][  ][ wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours ][  ][ motionless and spe ][ echless, wishing for
 some mighty revolution that ][  ][ might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins. ][  ][ The season of the as ][ sizes approached
.  I had already been three months ][  ][ in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a  ][ ][  ][ relap
se, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country ][  ][ town where the court was held.  Mr. Kirwin  ][ charged 
himself with every ][  ][ care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.  I was spared ][  ][ the disgrace of ap ][ pear
ing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not ][  ][ brought before the court that decides on life and death.  The grand ] ][ 
[  ][ jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney ][  ][ Islands at the hour the body of my friend was 
 ][ found; and a fortnight ][  ][ after my removal I was liberated from prison. ][  ][ My father was enraptured on finding me fr
eed  ][ from the vexations of a ][  ][ criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh ][  ][ atmosphere and perm
itted to ][  return to my native country.  I did not ][  ][ participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a
 ][  ][ pala ][ ce were alike hateful.  The cup of life was poisoned forever, and ][  ][ although the sun shone upon me, as upon
 the happy and g ][ ay of heart, I ][  ][ saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by ][  ][ no ligh
t but the glimmer of ][  two eyes that glared upon me.  Sometimes ][  ][ they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in 
death, the dark ][  ][ o ][ rbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed ][  ][ them; sometimes it was 
the watery, clouded eyes of  ][ the monster, as I ][  ][ first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt. ][  ][ My father tried to a
waken in me the feelings of affe ][ ction.  He talked ][  ][ of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but 
][  ][ these words only drew deep gr ][ oans from me.  Sometimes, indeed, I felt a ][  ][ wish for happiness and thought with me
lancholy delight of my beloved ][  ][ co ][ usin or longed, with a devouring maladie du pays, to see once more ][  ][ the blue l
ake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear t ][ o me in early ][  ][ childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in 
which a ][  ][ prison was as welcome a residence ][  as the divinest scene in nature; and ][  ][ these fits were seldom interrup
ted but by paroxysms of anguish and ][  ][ despair.  ][  At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the ][  ][ existe
nce I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and  ][ vigilance ][  ][ to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of
 violence. ][  ][ Yet one duty remained to me, the recollect ][ ion of which finally ][  ][ triumphed over my selfish despair.  
It was necessary that I should ][  ][ return without delay to Ge ][ neva, there to watch over the lives of those ][  ][ I so fon
dly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any ][  ][ ch ][ ance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he da
red again to ][  ][ blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing ai ][ m, put an end to ][  ][ the existence of the monstro
us image which  I had endued with the ][  ][ mockery of a soul still more mo ][ nstrous.  My father still desired to ][  ][ dela
y our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a ][  ][ journ ][ ey, for I was a shattered wreck--the shadow 
of a human being.  My ][  ][ strength was gone.  I was a mere skeleton, and fever ni ][ ght and day ][  ][ preyed upon my wasted
 frame.  Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland ][  ][ with such inquietude and impatienc ][ e, my father thought it best to ][  
][ yield.  We took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace ][  ][ and sailed  ][ with a fair wind from the Irish 
shores.  It was midnight.  I ][  ][ lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the da ][ shing of ][  ][ the waves.  
I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and ][  ][ my pulse beat with a feverish joy  ][ when I reflected that I 
should soon ][  ][ see Geneva.  The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; ][  ][ yet th ][ e vessel in which I 
was, the wind that blew me from the detested ][  ][ shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me told m ][ e too forcibly ]
[  ][ that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and ][  ][ dearest companion, had fallen a vi ][ ctim to me a
nd the monster of my ][  ][ creation.  I repassed, in my memory, my whole life--my quiet happiness ][  ][ while resi ][ ding wit
h my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my ][  ][ departure for Ingolstadt.  I remembered, shuddering, the ma ][ d en
thusiasm ][  ][ that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to ][  ][ mind the night in which he fi ][ 
rst lived.  I was unable to pursue the ][  ][ train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept ][  ][ bitterly.
 ][   Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the ][  ][ custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, 
for  ][ it was ][  ][ by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest ][  ][ necessary for the preservation of li
fe.  Opp ][ ressed by the recollection ][  ][ of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and ][  ][ soo
n slept prof ][ oundly.  But sleep did not afford me respite from ][  ][ thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand obje
cts that scared  ][ ][  ][ me.  Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the ][  ][ fiend's grasp in my ne
ck and could not fre ][ e myself from it; groans and ][  ][ cries rang in my ears.  My father, who was watching over me, perceiv
ing ][  ][ my restlessne ][ ss, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy ][  ][ sky above, the fiend was not here: a 
sense of security, a feeling ][  that ][  ][ a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible, ][  ][ disas
trous future imparted to me a ki ][ nd of calm forgetfulness, of which ][  ][ the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susc
eptible. ][  ][ Chapter 22 ][  ][ Th ][ e voyage came to an end.  We landed, and proceeded to Paris.  I soon ][  ][ found that I
 had overtaxed my strength and that I mu ][ st repose before I ][  ][ could continue my journey.  My father's care and attention
s were ][  ][ indefatigable, but he did not  ][ know the origin of my sufferings and ][  ][ sought erroneous methods to remedy t
he incurable ill.  He wished me to ][  ][ seek a ][ musement in society.  I abhorred the face of man.  Oh, not ][  ][ abhorred! 
 They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt ][  ][  ][ attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures
 of an ][  ][ angelic nature and celestial mechanism.  B ][ ut I felt that I had no right ][  ][ to share their intercourse.  I 
had unchained an enemy among them whose ][  ][ joy it was to ][  shed their blood and to revel in their groans.  How they ][  ][
 would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world did th ][ ey know ][  ][ my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had t
heir source in me! ][  ][ My father yielded at length to my desire t ][ o avoid society and strove by ][  ][ various arguments t
o banish my despair.  Sometimes he thought that I ][  ][ felt deeply the ][  degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of 
][  ][ murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride. ][   ][ ][ "Alas!  My father," said I, "how little do yo
u know me.  Human beings, ][  ][ their feelings and passions, would indeed be de ][ graded if such a wretch ][  ][ as I felt pri
de.  Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, ][  ][ and she suffered th ][ e same charge; she died for it; and I am
 the cause ][  ][ of this--I murdered her.  William, Justine, and Henry--they all died b ][ y ][  ][ my hands." ][  ][ My father
 had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same ][  ][ assertion; when I thus acc ][ used myself, he sometimes seemed
 to desire an ][  ][ explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring ][   ][ ][ of delirium, and that, du
ring my illness, some idea of this kind had ][  ][ presented itself to my imagination, the remembran ][ ce of which I ][  ][ pre
served in my convalescence. ][  ][ I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning t ][ he ][  ][ wretch I h
ad created.  I had a persuasion that I should be supposed ][  ][ mad, and this in itself would forever have  ][ chained my tongu
e.  But, ][  ][ besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill ][  ][ my hearer with co ][ nsternation 
and make fear and unnatural horror the ][  ][ inmates of his breast.  I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for  ][ ][  ][ s
ympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have ][  ][ confided the fatal secret.  Yet, still, words li ][ ke t
hose I have ][  ][ recorded would burst uncontrollably from me.  I could offer no ][  ][ explanation of them, but their trut ][ 
h in part relieved the burden of my ][  ][ mysterious woe.  Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression ][  ][ of unbo
 ][ unded wonder, "My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this?  My ][  ][ dear son, I entreat you never to make such an asserti
on a ][ gain." ][  ][ "I am not mad," I cried energetically; "the sun and the heavens, who ][  ][ have viewed my operations, can
 bear wi ][ tness of my truth.  I am the ][  ][ assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. ][  ][ A 
thousand tim ][ es would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have ][  ][ saved their lives; but I could not, my father, i
ndeed I could no ][ t ][  ][ sacrifice the whole human race." ][  ][ The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my i
deas were ][  ][ der ][ anged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and ][  ][ endeavoured to alter the cour
se of my thoughts.  He w ][ ished as much as ][  ][ possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in ][  
][ Ireland and never alluded ][  to them or suffered me to speak of my ][  ][ misfortunes. ][  ][ As time passed away I became m
ore calm; misery had her dwellin ][ g in my ][  ][ heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own ][  ][ 
crimes; sufficient for me was the co ][ nsciousness of them.  By the utmost ][  ][ self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of
 wretchedness, which ][  ][ sometimes de ][ sired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners ][  ][ were calmer and mo
re composed than they had ever been since my ][  journey ][  ][ to the sea of ice.  A few days before we left Paris on our way t
o ][  ][ Switzerland, I received the following l ][ etter from Elizabeth: ][  ][ "My dear Friend, ][  ][ "It gave me the greates
t pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle ][  ][  ][ dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may ][
  ][ hope to see you in less than a fortnight.  My poor  ][ cousin, how much you ][  ][ must have suffered!  I expect to see you
 looking even more ill than ][  ][ when you quitted Geneva.  ][  This winter has been passed most miserably, ][  ][ tortured as 
I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in ][   ][ ][ your countenance and to find that your heart is not total
ly void of ][  ][ comfort and tranquillity. ][  ][ "Yet I fear that  ][ the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable ]
[  ][ a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.  I would not disturb y ][ ou at ][  ][ this period, when so many misfortunes w
eigh upon you, but a ][  ][ conversation that I had with my uncle previous t ][ o his departure renders ][  ][ some explanation 
necessary before we meet.   Explanation!  You may ][  ][ possibly say, What can  ][ Elizabeth have to explain?  If you really sa
y ][  ][ this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.  But you ][  ] ][ [ are distant from me, and it is possibl
e that you may dread and yet be ][  ][ pleased with this explanation; and in a probabili ][ ty of this being the ][  ][ case, I 
dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, ][  ][ I have often wished t ][ o express to you but have never 
had the courage to ][  ][ begin. ][  ][ "You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favo ][ urite plan of ][  ][ your pa
rents ever since our infancy.  We were told this when young, and ][  ][ taught to look forward to it ][  as an event that would 
certainly take ][  ][ place.  We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I ][  ][ believe,  ][ dear and valued frie
nds to one another as we grew older. But ][  ][ as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection tow ][ ards each ][  ][
 other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our ][  ][ case?  Tell me, dearest Victor.   ][ Answer me, I
 conjure you by our mutual ][  ][ happiness, with simple truth--Do you not love another? ][  ][ "You have travelled; ][  you hav
e spent several years of your life at ][  ][ Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last ][  ] ][ [ au
tumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every ][  ][ creature, I could not help supposing that you might reg ][ 
ret our ][  ][ connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of ][  ][ your parents, although they oppose
 ][ d themselves to your inclinations. ][  ][ But this is false reasoning.  I confess to you, my friend, that I love ][  ][ you 
and  ][ that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant ][  ][ friend and companion.   But it is your happiness I d
esire as ][  well as my ][  ][ own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally ][  ][ miserable unless it 
were the dic ][ tate of your own free choice.  Even now ][  ][ I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest ][  
][ misfortunes,  ][ you may stifle, by the word 'honour,' all hope of that ][  ][ love and happiness which would alone restore y
ou to yourself.  I,  ][ who ][  ][ have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries ][  ][ tenfold by bein
g an obstacle to your wi ][ shes.  Ah! Victor, be assured ][  ][ that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you no
t to be ][  ][ made miserabl ][ e by this supposition.  Be happy, my friend; and if you ][  ][ obey me in this one request, rema
in satisfied that nothing on ear ][ th ][  ][ will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity. ][  ][ "Do not let this letter d
isturb you; do not answer tomorrow,  ][ or the ][  ][ next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.  My uncle ][  
][ will send me news of your health, and ][  if I see but one smile on your ][  ][ lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any 
other exertion of mine, I ][  ][ shall need  ][ no other happiness. ][  ][                                                 "Eliz
abeth Lavenza ][  ][     "Geneva, May 18th, 17-- ][ " ][  ][ This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the ]
[  ][ threat of the fiend--"I WILL BE WITH YOU ON YO ][ UR WEDDING-NIGHT!" Such ][  ][ was my sentence, and on that night would 
the daemon employ every art to ][  ][ destroy me and tea ][ r me from the glimpse of happiness which promised ][  ][ partly to c
onsole my sufferings.  On that night he had determined to ][ ][   ][ consummate his crimes by my death.  Well, be it so; a deadl
y struggle ][  ][ would then assuredly take place, in which if h ][ e were victorious I ][  ][ should be at peace and his power 
over me be at an end.  If he were ][  ][ vanquished, I should be a f ][ ree man.  Alas!  What freedom?  Such as the ][  ][ peasa
nt enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his ][  ] ][ [ cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is tur
ned adrift, homeless, ][  ][ penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be m ][ y liberty except that in ][  ][ my Elizabeth I p
ossessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of ][  ][ remorse and guilt ][  which would pursue me until death. ][  ][ S
weet and beloved Elizabeth!  I read and reread her letter, and some ][  ][ softened  ][ feelings stole into my heart and dared t
o whisper paradisiacal ][  ][ dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, a ][ nd the ][  ][ angel's arm bared to d
rive me from all hope.  Yet I would die to make ][  ][ her happy.  If the monster executed h ][ is threat, death was inevitable;
 ][  ][ yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate.  My ][  ][ destructio ][ n might indeed arrive a few 
months sooner, but if my torturer ][  ][ should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menac ][ es, he would ][  ][ sure
ly find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. ][  ][ He had vowed TO BE WITH ME ON MY WEDDIN ][ G-NIGHT, yet he did 
not consider ][  ][ that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show ][  ][ me that he ][  was not yet sat
iated with blood, he had murdered Clerval ][  ][ immediately after the enunciation of his threats.  I resolved,  ][ ][  ][ there
fore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce ][  ][ either to hers or my father's happiness, my adv ][ ersary's
 designs against ][  ][ my life should not retard it a single hour. ][  ][ In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.   ][ My l
etter was calm and ][  ][ affectionate.  "I fear, my beloved girl," I said, "little happiness ][  ][ remains for us on earth ][ 
; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in ][  ][ you.  Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life ]
 ][ [  ][ and my endeavours for contentment.  I have one secret, Elizabeth, a ][  ][ dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will
 chi ][ ll your frame with ][  ][ horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only ][  ][ wonder that I su
rvive wh ][ at I have endured.  I will confide this tale of ][  ][ misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall tak
e place, ][  ][  ][ for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.  But ][  ][ until then, I conjure you, do
 not mention or  ][ allude to it.  This I most ][  ][ earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply." ][  ][ In about a week aft
er the arrival of El ][ izabeth's letter we returned to ][  ][ Geneva.  The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tear
s were ][  ][ in her eye ][ s as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish  cheeks.  I ][  ][ saw a change in her also.  She wa
s thinner and had lost much  ][ of that ][  ][ heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and ][  ][ soft 
looks of compassion made her a m ][ ore fit companion for one blasted ][  ][ and miserable as I was.  The tranquillity which I n
ow enjoyed did not ][  ][ endure.  M ][ emory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had ][  ][ passed, a real insa
nity possessed me; sometimes I was furio ][ us and burnt ][  ][ with rage, sometimes low and despondent.  I neither spoke nor lo
oked at ][  ][ anyone, but sat motionless, b ][ ewildered by the multitude of miseries ][  ][ that overcame me. ][  ][ Elizabeth
 alone had the power to draw me from these fits; ][  her gentle ][  ][ voice would soothe me when transported by passion and ins
pire me with ][  ][ human feelings when sunk in torp ][ or.  She wept with me and for me.  When ][  ][ reason returned, she woul
d remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with ][  ][ re ][ signation.  Ah!  It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but 
][  ][ for the guilty there is no peace.  The agonies of rem ][ orse poison the ][  ][ luxury there is otherwise sometimes found
 in indulging the excess of ][  ][ grief.  Soon after my arrival ][  my father spoke of my immediate marriage ][  ][ with Elizab
eth.  I remained silent. ][  ][ "Have you, then, some other attachme ][ nt?" ][  ][ "None on earth.  I love Elizabeth and look f
orward to our union with ][  ][ delight.  Let the day therefore be fixed ][ ; and on it I will consecrate ][  ][ myself, in life
 or death, to the happiness of my cousin." ][  ][ "My dear Victor, do not sp ][ eak thus.  Heavy misfortunes have befallen ][  ]
[ us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love ][  ][  ][ for those whom we have lost to those who yet
 live.  Our circle will be ][  ][ small but bound close by the ties of affection and ][  mutual misfortune. ][  ][ And when time
 shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of ][  ][ care will be born to r ][ eplace those of whom we have been so
 cruelly ][  ][ deprived." ][  ][ Such were the lessons of my father.  But to me the remembr ][ ance of the ][  ][ threat return
ed; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had ][  ][ yet been in his deeds of blood,  ][ I should almost regard him a
s ][  ][ invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words "I SHALL BE WITH ][  ][ YOU ON YOUR W ][ EDDING-NIGHT," I should 
regard the threatened fate as ][  ][ unavoidable.  But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth  ][ were ][  ][ balanced
 with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful ][  ][ countenance, agreed with my father that ][  if my cousin wo
uld consent, the ][  ][ ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, ][  ][ the seal to  ][ my fate. ][ 
 ][ Great God!  If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish ][  ][ intention of my fiendish adversary ][ , I woul
d rather have banished myself ][  ][ forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over ][  ][ the ea ][ rth 
than have consented to this miserable marriage.  But, as if ][  ][ possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to  ][ 
his real ][  ][ intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I ][  ][ hastened that of a far dearer vic
 ][ tim. ][  ][ As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from ][  ][ cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt m
y he ][ art sink within me.  But ][  ][ I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought ][  ][ smiles and joy 
to the c ][ ountenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ][  ][ ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth.  She looked forwar
d to our ][  ][  ][ union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which ][  ][ past misfortunes had impressed
, that what now  ][ appeared certain and ][  ][ tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no ][  ][ t
race but deep and ev ][ erlasting regret.  Preparations were made for the ][  ][ event, congratulatory visits were received, and
 all wore a smiling ][   ][ ][ appearance.  I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety ][  ][ that preyed there 
and entered with seeming ear ][ nestness into the plans ][  ][ of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations o
f my ][  ][ tragedy.  Through my ][  father's exertions a part of the inheritance of ][  ][ Elizabeth had been restored to her b
y the Austrian government.  A small  ][ ][  ][ possession on the shores of Como belonged to her.  It was agreed that, ][  ][ imm
ediately after our union, we should proc ][ eed to Villa Lavenza and ][  ][ spend our first days of happiness beside the beautif
ul lake near which ][  ][ it stood. ][  ][ I ][ n the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the ][  ][ fi
end should openly attack me.  I carried pistols  ][ and a dagger ][  ][ constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent
 artifice, and ][  ][ by these means gained a greate ][ r degree of tranquillity.  Indeed, as the ][  ][ period approached, the 
threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be ][  ][ reg ][ arded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for
 ][  ][ in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certaint ][ y as the day fixed ][  ][ for its solemnization drew nearer and 
I heard it continually spoken of ][  ][ as an occurrence which n ][ o accident could possibly prevent. ][  ][ Elizabeth seemed h
appy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to ][  ][ calm her m ][ ind.  But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my
 ][  ][ destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded ][  her; ][  ][ and perhaps also she thought of the dre
adful secret which I had ][  ][ promised to reveal to her on the following d ][ ay.  My father was in the ][  ][ meantime overjo
yed and in the bustle of preparation only recognized in ][  ][ the melancholy of ][  his niece the diffidence of a bride. ][  ][
 After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my ][  ][ father's, but ][  it was agreed that Elizabeth and I shou
ld commence our ][  ][ journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our ][  ][  ][ voyage on the following day.
  The day was fair, the wind favourable; ][  ][ all smiled on our nuptial embarkation. ][  ] ][ [ Those were the last moments of
 my life during which I enjoyed the ][  ][ feeling of happiness.  We passed rapidly along; the s ][ un was hot, but we ][  ][ we
re sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the ][  ][ beauty of the scene, some ][ times on one side of the
 lake, where we saw ][  ][ Mont Saleve, the pleasant banks of Montalegre, and at a distance, ][  ][ surm ][ ounting all, the bea
utiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy ][  ][ mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; someti ][ mes coasting the
 ][  ][ opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ][  ][ ambition that would quit its ][  native coun
try, and an almost ][  ][ insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it. ][  ][ I took the han ][ d of Eli
zabeth.  "You are sorrowful, my love.  Ah!  If ][  ][ you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would ][  ][ 
 ][ endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this ][  ][ one day at least permits me to enjoy." ][  ][ 
 ][ "Be happy, my dear Victor," replied Elizabeth; "there is, I hope, ][  ][ nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a l
 ][ ively joy is not ][  ][ painted in my face, my heart is contented.  Something whispers to me ][  ][ not to depend too much o
n th ][ e prospect that is opened before us, but I ][  ][ will not listen to such a sinister voice.  Observe how fast we move ][
  ][ alo ][ ng and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise ][  ][ above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this s
cene of beau ][ ty still more ][  ][ interesting.  Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in ][  ][ the clear water
s, where we can  ][ distinguish every pebble that lies at ][  ][ the bottom.  What a divine day!  How happy and serene all natur
e ][  ][ appears!" ] ][ [  ][ Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all ][  ][ reflection upon melanch
oly subjects.  But her t ][ emper was fluctuating; ][  ][ joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave plac
e ][  ][ to distraction and  ][ reverie. ][  ][ The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and ][  ][ observe
d its path through the chasms of ][  the higher and the glens of the ][  ][ lower hills.  The Alps here come closer to the lake,
 and we approached ][  ][ the amphit ][ heatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.  The ][  ][ spire of Evian shone u
nder the woods that surrounded it and th ][ e range ][  ][ of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung. ][  ][ The wind,
 which had hitherto carried us along with am ][ azing rapidity, ][  ][ sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffl
ed the water ][  ][ and caused a pleasant motion ][  among the trees as we approached the ][  ][ shore, from which it wafted the
 most delightful scent of flowers and ][  ][ hay.  T ][ he sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched ][  ][ th
e shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon w ][ ere to clasp ][  ][ me and cling to me forever. ][  ][ Chapter 23 ][
  ][ It was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for a sh ][ ort time on the ][  ][ shore, enjoying the transitory light, and
 then retired to the inn and ][  ][ contemplated the lovely scen ][ e of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured ][  ][ in darkne
ss, yet still displaying their black outlines. ][  ][ The wind, whic ][ h had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence 
][  ][ in the west.  The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and  ][ was ][  ][ beginning to descend; the clouds swept ac
ross it swifter than the ][  ][ flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, w ][ hile the lake reflected the ][  ][ scene of the 
busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves ][  ][ that were begin ][ ning to rise.  Suddenly a heavy storm of rai
n descended. ][  ][ I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured th ][ e ][  ][ shapes of objects, a thousand f
ears arose in my mind.  I was anxious ][  ][ and watchful, while my right hand grasped a ][  pistol which was hidden in ][  ][ m
y bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my ][  ][ life dearly an ][ d not shrink from the conflict u
ntil my own life or that ][  ][ of my adversary was extinguished.  Elizabeth observed my agitati ][ on for ][  ][ some time in t
imid and fearful silence, but there was something in my ][  ][ glance which communicated terror to h ][ er, and trembling, she a
sked, ][  ][ "What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?  What is it you fear?" ][  ][ "Oh!  Peace, p ][ eace, my love," repl
ied I; "this night, and all will be ][  ][ safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful." ][  ][ I passed ][  an hour in this
 state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how ][  ][ fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to ][  my wife, ][
  ][ and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her ][  ][ until I had obtained some knowledge a ][ s to the
 situation of my enemy. ][  ][ She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages ][  ][ of the hou ][ se a
nd inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to ][  ][ my adversary.  But I discovered no trace of him and was beg ][ 
inning to ][  ][ conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the ][  ][ execution of his menaces when sudden
 ][ ly I heard a shrill and dreadful ][  ][ scream.  It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.  As I ][  ][ heard 
it,  ][ the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the ][  ][ motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could
 feel th ][ e blood ][  ][ trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This ][  ][ state lasted but for a
n instant; t ][ he scream was repeated, and I rushed ][  ][ into the room.  Great God!  Why did I not then expire!  Why am I her
e ][  ][ to rela ][ te the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on ][  ][ earth?  She was there, lifeless and in
animate, thrown acro ][ ss the bed, ][  ][ her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered ][  ][ by her 
hair.  Everywhere I turn ][  I see the same figure--her bloodless ][  ][ arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its brid
al bier.  Could ][  ][ I beh ][ old this and live?  Alas!  Life is obstinate and clings closest ][  ][ where it is most hated.  
For a moment only did I lose rec ][ ollection; I ][  ][ fell senseless on the ground. ][  ][ When I recovered I found myself sur
rounded by the people of the inn; ][ ][   ][ their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of ][  ][ others a
ppeared only as a mockery, a shadow of t ][ he feelings that ][  ][ oppressed me.  I escaped from them to the room where lay the
 body of ][  ][ Elizabeth, my love, my wife, ][  so lately living, so dear, so worthy.  She ][  ][ had been moved from the postu
re in which I had first beheld her, and ][  ][ n ][ ow, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across ][  ]
[ her face and neck, I might have supposed her aslee ][ p. I rushed towards ][  ][ her and embraced her with ardour, but the dea
dly languor and coldness ][  ][ of the limbs told me tha ][ t what I now held in my arms had ceased to be ][  ][ the Elizabeth w
hom I had loved and cherished.  The murderous mark of ][  ][ ][  the fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to
 issue ][  ][ from her lips.  While I still hung over her in the ][  agony of despair, I ][  ][ happened to look up.  The window
s of the room had before been darkened, ][  ][ and I felt a kind of  ][ panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon ][  ][
 illuminate the chamber.  The shutters had been thrown back, and with a  ][ ][  ][ sensation of horror not to be described, I sa
w at the open window a ][  ][ figure the most hideous and abhorred.  A grin  ][ was on the face of the ][  ][ monster; he seemed
 to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed ][  ][ towards the corpse of my ][  wife.  I rushed towards the window, and ][ 
 ][ drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from ][  ][ his  ][ station, and running with the swiftness 
of lightning, plunged into ][  ][ the lake. ][  ][ The report of the pistol brought a cr ][ owd into the room. I pointed to ][  
][ the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with ][  ][ boats; nets were ][  cast, but in vain.  After passi
ng several hours, we ][  ][ returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a ][  ][  ][ form conjured up by 
my fancy.  After having landed, they proceeded to ][  ][ search the country, parties going in differ ][ ent directions among the
 ][  ][ woods and vines. ][  ][ I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the ][ ][   ][ house, but my h
ead whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken ][  ][ man, I fell at last in a state of utter exha ][ ustion; a film c
overed my ][  ][ eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.  In this state I ][  ][ was carried back  ][ and placed o
n a bed, hardly conscious of what had ][  ][ happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that  ][ ][  ][ I
 had lost. ][  ][ After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room ][  ][ where the corpse of my  ][ belo
ved lay.  There were women weeping around; I ][  ][ hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no ][  ][  ][ 
distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to ][  ][ various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfo
 ][ rtunes and their ][  ][ cause.  I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.  The death ][  ][ of William, the executi
on o ][ f Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly ][  ][ of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining ][
  ][ fri ][ ends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now ][  ][ might be writhing under his grasp, and Ern
est might be ][  dead at his ][  ][ feet.  This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.  I started ][  ][ up and resolve
d to return to G ][ eneva with all possible speed. ][  ][ There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; bu
t ][  ][ the wind wa ][ s unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents.  However, it ][  ][ was hardly morning, and I might reaso
nably hope to arrive by  ][ night.  I ][  ][ hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced ][  ][ relief
 from mental torment in bodi ][ ly exercise.  But the overflowing ][  ][ misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I e
ndured rendered ][  ][ me incapa ][ ble of any exertion.  I threw down the oar, and leaning my ][  ][ head upon my hands, gave w
ay to every gloomy idea that arose.  ][  If I ][  ][ looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time ][  ][
 and which I had contemplated but the da ][ y before in the company of her ][  ][ who was now but a shadow and a recollection.  
Tears streamed from my ][  ][ eyes.  The rai ][ n had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the ][  ][ waters as they 
had done a few hours before; they had then been  ][ observed ][  ][ by Elizabeth.  Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a 
great and ][  ][ sudden change.  The sun might shine ][  or the clouds might lower, but ][  ][ nothing could appear to me as it 
had done the day before.  A fiend had ][  ][ snatched fr ][ om me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever ][  ][ be
en so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in ][  the ][  ][ history of man. But why should I dwell upon the inci
dents that followed ][  ][ this last overwhelming event?  Mine h ][ as been a tale of horrors; I have ][  ][ reached their acme,
 and what I must now relate can but be tedious to ][  ][ you.  Know  ][ that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was l
eft ][  ][ desolate.  My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in  ][ a few ][  ][ words, what remains of my hideous narra
tion. I arrived at Geneva.  My ][  ][ father and Ernest yet lived, but the f ][ ormer sunk under the tidings that ][  ][ I bore.
  I see him now, excellent and venerable old man!  His eyes ][  ][ wandered in v ][ acancy, for they had lost their charm and th
eir ][  ][ delight--his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with ][  ][  ][ all that affection which a man feels
, who in the decline of life, ][  ][ having few affections, clings more earnestly to tho ][ se that remain. ][  ][ Cursed, curse
d be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and ][  ][ doomed him to waste in wretc ][ hedness!  He could not live unde
r the ][  ][ horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence ][  ][ suddenly  ][ gave way; he was unable to r
ise from his bed, and in a few ][  ][ days he died in my arms. ][  ][ What then became of me?  I kno ][ w not; I lost sensation,
 and chains and ][  ][ darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.  Sometimes, ][  ][ indeed, I ][  dreamt that I wande
red in flowery meadows and pleasant vales ][  ][ with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself  ][ in a ][  ][ dung
eon.  Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear ][  ][ conception of my miseries and situation and wa ][ s then relea
sed from my ][  ][ prison.  For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I ][  ][ understood, a solitary c ][ ell had 
been my habitation. ][  ][ Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I ][  ][ awakened to reason, a ][ t th
e same time awakened to revenge.  As the ][  ][ memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their ][   ][ 
][ cause--the monster whom I had created, the miserable daemon whom I had ][  ][ sent abroad into the world for my destruction. 
 ][  I was possessed by a ][  ][ maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed ][  ][ that I might have 
him  ][ within my grasp to wreak a great and signal ][  ][ revenge on his cursed head. ][  ][ Nor did my hate long confine itsel
f to use ][ less wishes; I began to ][  ][ reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about ][  ][ a month
 after my re ][ lease, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town ][  ][ and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I k
new the ][  ][ d ][ estroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole ][  ][ authority for the apprehension of t
he murderer.  The ma ][ gistrate ][  ][ listened to me with attention and kindness. ][  ][ "Be assured, sir," said he, "no pains
 or exertions on my part ][  shall be ][  ][ spared to discover the villain." ][  ][ "I thank you," replied I; "listen, therefor
e, to the deposition that I  ][ ][  ][ have to make.  It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you ][  ][ would not cre
dit it were there not something  ][ in truth which, however ][  ][ wonderful, forces conviction.  The story is too connected to 
be ][  ][ mistaken for a dream, and  ][ I have no motive for falsehood." My manner as ][  ][ I thus addressed him was impressive
 but calm; I had formed in my own ][  ][ ][  heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose ][  ][ quieted
 my agony and for an interval reconciled me  ][ to life.  I now ][  ][ related my history briefly but with firmness and precisio
n, marking the ][  ][ dates with accuracy and ne ][ ver deviating into invective or exclamation. ][  ][ The magistrate appeared 
at first perfectly incredulous, but as I ][  ][ cont ][ inued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes ][  ]
[ shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmi ][ ngled with ][  ][ disbelief, was painted on his countenance.  When I
 had concluded my ][  ][ narration I said, "This is the bein ][ g whom I accuse and for whose ][  ][ seizure and punishment I ca
ll upon you to exert your whole power.  It ][  ][ is your duty a ][ s a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings ][
  ][ as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions  ][ on this ][  ][ occasion."  This address caused a conside
rable change in the ][  ][ physiognomy of my own auditor.  He had heard  ][ my story with that half ][  ][ kind of belief that i
s given to a tale of spirits and supernatural ][  ][ events; but when he was ][  called upon to act officially in consequence, ]
[  ][ the whole tide of his incredulity returned.  He, however, answered ][  ][  ][ mildly, "I would willingly afford you every 
aid in your pursuit, but ][  ][ the creature of whom you speak appears to have power ][ s which would put ][  ][ all my exertion
s to defiance.  Who can follow an animal which can ][  ][ traverse the sea of ice and in ][ habit caves and dens where no man wo
uld ][  ][ venture to intrude?  Besides, some months have elapsed since the ][  ][ commissio ][ n of his crimes, and no one can 
conjecture to what place he ][  ][ has wandered or what region he may now inhabit." ][  ][ "I do ][  not doubt that he hovers ne
ar the spot which I inhabit, and if he ][  ][ has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted  ][ like the chamois ][  ][ 
and destroyed as a beast of prey.  But I perceive your thoughts; you do ][  ][ not credit my narrative a ][ nd do not intend to 
pursue my enemy with the ][  ][ punishment which is his desert." As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; ][  ] ][ [ the magistrate
 was intimidated.  "You are mistaken," said he.  "I will ][  ][ exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize  ][ the monster,
 be assured ][  ][ that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes.  But I ][  ][ fear, from what you ha ][ ve yours
elf described to be his properties, that ][  ][ this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is ] ][ [  ]
[ pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment." ][  ][ "That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little ][ 
 avail.  My ][  ][ revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I ][  ][ confess that it is the devouring
 ][  and only passion of my soul.  My rage ][  ][ is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned ][  ][ loo
se u ][ pon society, still exists.  You refuse my just demand; I have ][  ][ but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my
 life or ][  death, to ][  ][ his destruction." ][  ][ I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy ][
  ][ in my m ][ anner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness ][  ][ which the martyrs of old are said to have p
ossessed.  But t ][ o a Genevan ][  ][ magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of ][  ][ devotion and 
heroism, this elevat ][ ion of mind had much the appearance of ][  ][ madness.  He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a ch
ild and ][  ][ reverted  ][ to my tale as the effects of delirium. ][  ][ "Man," I cried, "how ignorant art thou in thy pride of
 wisdom!  Cease; ][  ][ you  ][ know not what it is you say." ][  ][ I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to m
editate on ][  ][ some other mod ][ e of action. ][  ][ Chapter 24 ][  ][ My present situation was one in which all voluntary th
ought was ][  ][ swallowed up and lo ][ st.  I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone ][  ][ endowed me with strength and compo
sure; it moulded my feelings and ][  ][  ][ allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise ][  ][ delirium or d
eath would have been my portion. ][  ][ My f ][ irst resolution was to quit Geneva forever; my country, which, when ][  ][ I was
 happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my a ][ dversity, became ][  ][ hateful.  I provided myself with a sum of money, tog
ether with a few ][  ][ jewels which had belonged to ][  my mother, and departed.  And now my ][  ][ wanderings began which are 
to cease but with life.  I have traversed a ][  ][ vast  ][ portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which ][  ][
 travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to m ][ eet.  How I ][  ][ have lived I hardly know; many times have I s
tretched my failing limbs ][  ][ upon the sandy plain and prayed ][  for death.  But revenge kept me alive; ][  ][ I dared not d
ie and leave my adversary in being. ][  ][ When I quitted Geneva my  ][ first labour was to gain some clue by which I ][  ][ mig
ht trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.  But my plan was unsettled, ][  ][  ][ and I wandered many hours round the confines of 
the town, uncertain ][  ][ what path I should pursue.  As night approached I ][  found myself at the ][  ][ entrance of the ceme
tery where William, Elizabeth, and my father ][  ][ reposed.  I entered it and a ][ pproached the tomb which marked their ][  ][
 graves.  Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which ][  ][ were ge ][ ntly agitated by the wind; the night was
 nearly dark, and the ][  ][ scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an unint ][ erested ][  ][ observer.  The spirit
s of the departed seemed to flit around and to ][  ][ cast a shadow, which was felt but not  ][ seen, around the head of the ][ 
 ][ mourner. ][  ][ The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way ][  ][ ][  to rage and despair.  They 
were dead, and I lived; their murderer also ][  ][ lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my wear ][ y existence.  I knelt ][
  ][ on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, ][  ][ "By the sacred earth on ][  which I kneel, by t
he shades that wander near ][  ][ me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O ][  ][  ][ Night, and t
he spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the daemon who ][  ][ caused this misery, until he or I shall peris ][ h in mortal 
conflict.  For ][  ][ this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will ][  ][ I again behold  ][ the sun 
and tread the green herbage of earth, which ][  ][ otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever.  And I call on you, ][  ][  ][ 
spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to ][  ][ aid and conduct me in my work.  Let the cursed  ][ 
and hellish monster ][  ][ drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me."  I ][  ][ had begun my adjuratio
 ][ n with solemnity and an awe which almost assured ][  ][ me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my ][  
][ d ][ evotion, but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked ][  ][ my utterance. ][  ][ I was answered through 
the stil ][ lness of night by a loud and fiendish ][  ][ laugh.  It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed ][
  ][ it, and ][  I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter. ][  ][ Surely in that moment I should have been 
possessed by fre ][ nzy and have ][  ][ destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I ][  ][ was reserve
d for vengeance.  Th ][ e laughter died away, when a well-known ][  ][ and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed
 me in an ][  ][ audible ][  whisper, "I am satisfied, miserable wretch!  You have ][  ][ determined to live, and I am satisfied
." ][  ][ I darted towards t ][ he spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil ][  ][ eluded my grasp.  Suddenly the broa
d disk of the moon arose and sho ][ ne ][  ][ full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than ][  ][ mortal 
speed. ][  ][ I pursued him, and for ][  many months this has been my task.  Guided by a ][  ][ slight clue, I followed the wind
ings of the Rhone, but vainly.  The ][   ][ ][ blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend ][  ][ ente
r by night and hide himself in a vessel boun ][ d for the Black Sea.  I ][  ][ took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped,
 I know not how. ][  ][ Amidst the wilds of Tart ][ ary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I ][  ][ have ever followed in 
his track.  Sometimes the peasants, scared by ][  ][ ][  this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, 
][  ][ who feared that if I lost all trace of him I shou ][ ld despair and die, ][  ][ left some mark to guide me.  The snows de
scended on my head, and I saw ][  ][ the print of his huge s ][ tep on the white plain.  To you first entering ][  ][ on life, t
o whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand ][  ][  ][ what I have felt and still feel?  Cold, want, and fatigu
e were the ][  ][ least pains which I was destined to endure; I was  ][ cursed by some devil ][  ][ and carried about with me my
 eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good ][  ][ followed and directed m ][ y steps and when I most murmured would suddenly ][  
][ extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.  Sometimes, ][   ][ ][ when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under t
he exhaustion, a repast ][  ][ was prepared for me in the desert that restored a ][ nd inspirited me.  The ][  ][ fare was, inde
ed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but ][  ][ I will not doubt tha ][ t it was set there by the spirits that I
 had ][  ][ invoked to aid me.  Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and ][   ][ ][ I was parched by thirst, a slight
 cloud would bedim the sky, shed the ][  ][ few drops that revived me, and vanish. ][  ][ I  ][ followed, when I could, the cour
ses of the rivers; but the daemon ][  ][ generally avoided these, as it was here that the popula ][ tion of the ][  ][ country c
hiefly collected.  In other places human beings were seldom ][  ][ seen, and I generally subsisted o ][ n the wild animals that 
crossed my ][  ][ path.  I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers ][  ][ by distri ][ buting it; or I brou
ght with me some food that I had killed, ][  ][ which, after taking a small part, I always presented to thos ][ e who had ][  ][
 provided me with fire and utensils for cooking. ][  ][ My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, an ][ d it was dur
ing ][  ][ sleep alone that I could taste joy.  O blessed sleep!  Often, when most ][  ][ miserable, I sank to repos ][ e, and m
y dreams lulled me even to rapture. ][  ][ The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather ][  ][ hour ][ s, o
f happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my ][  ][ pilgrimage.  Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under ][ 
 my ][  ][ hardships.  During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope ][  ][ of night, for in sleep I saw my friends,
 ][  my wife, and my beloved ][  ][ country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the ][  ][ silver tones 
of m ][ y Elizabeth's voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying ][  ][ health and youth.  Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I pe
rsuaded  ][ ][  ][ myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should ][  ][ then enjoy reality in the arms of
 my dearest  ][ friends.  What agonizing ][  ][ fondness did I feel for them!  How did I cling to their dear forms, as ][  ][ so
metimes they hau ][ nted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that ][  ][ they still lived!  At such moments vengeance, tha
t burned within me,  ][ ][  ][ died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the ][  ][ daemon more as a ta
sk enjoined by heaven, a ][ s the mechanical impulse of ][  ][ some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire 
of my ][  ][ soul.  What his ][  feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know.  Sometimes, ][  ][ indeed, he left marks in writing
 on the barks of the trees or cu ][ t in ][  ][ stone that guided me and instigated my fury.  "My reign is not yet ][  ][ over"-
-these words were legible in one of  ][ these inscriptions--"you ][  ][ live, and my power is complete.  Follow me; I seek the e
verlasting ices ][  ][ of the north, whe ][ re you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to ][  ][ which I am impassive.  You 
will find near this place, if you follow not ][  ][  ][ too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed.  Come on, my enemy; we ]
[  ][ have yet to wrestle for our lives, but man ][ y hard and miserable hours ][  ][ must you endure until that period shall ar
rive." ][  ][ Scoffing devil!  Again do I vow vengea ][ nce; again do I devote thee, ][  ][ miserable fiend, to torture and deat
h.  Never will I give up my search ][  ][ until he or I  ][ perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my ][  ][ Elizabeth 
and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the ][  ][  ][ reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage! ][  ][ As
 I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickene ][ d and ][  ][ the cold increased in a degree almost too sever
e to support.  The ][  ][ peasants were shut up in their hovels, and ][  only a few of the most hardy ][  ][ ventured forth to s
eize the animals whom starvation had forced from ][  ][ their hiding-pla ][ ces to seek for prey.  The rivers were covered with 
][  ][ ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my ][ ][   ][ chief article of maintenance.  The triumph 
of my enemy increased with ][  ][ the difficulty of my labours.  One inscription ][  that he left was in ][  ][ these words:  "P
repare!  Your toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs ][  ][ and provide food, for w ][ e shall soon enter upon a journey where 
your ][  ][ sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred." ][  ][ My courage and persev ][ erance were invigorated by these sco
ffing words; I ][  ][ resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on heaven to support ] ][ [  ][ me, I continued with unaba
ted fervour to traverse immense deserts, ][  ][ until the ocean appeared at a distance and forme ][ d the utmost boundary ][  ][
 of the horizon.  Oh!  How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the ][  ][ south!  Covered with ice, ][  it was only to be disti
nguished from land by ][  ][ its superior wildness and ruggedness.  The Greeks wept for joy when ][  ][  ][ they beheld the Medi
terranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with ][  ][ rapture the boundary of their toils.  I did not wee ][ p, but I knelt d
own ][  ][ and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in ][  ][ safety to the place where ][  I hoped, no
twithstanding my adversary's gibe, ][  ][ to meet and grapple with him. ][  ][ Some weeks before this period I had p ][ rocured 
a sledge and dogs and thus ][  ][ traversed the snows with inconceivable speed.  I know not whether the ][  ][ fiend pos ][ sess
ed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had ][  ][ daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so m ][ 
uch so that ][  ][ when I first saw the ocean he was but one day's journey in advance, and ][  ][ I hoped to intercept him befor
 ][ e he should reach the beach.  With new ][  ][ courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched ][  ][
 ham ][ let on the seashore.  I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the ][  ][ fiend and gained accurate information.  A giga
ntic mon ][ ster, they said, ][  ][ had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, ][  ][ putting to flight th
e inhabitant ][ s of a solitary cottage through fear of ][  ][ his terrific appearance.  He had carried off their store of winte
r ][  ][ food, a ][ nd placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a ][  ][ numerous drove of trained dogs, he had ha
rnessed them, and th ][ e same ][  ][ night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his ][  ][ journey across th
e sea in a direction tha ][ t led to no land; and they ][  ][ conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of 
the ][  ][ ice or frozen by  ][ the eternal  frosts. ][  ][ On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair
. ][  ][ He had escaped me, and  ][ I must commence a destructive and almost endless ][  ][ journey across the mountainous ices 
of the ocean, amidst cold that few ] ][ [  ][ of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a ][  ][ genial an
d sunny climate, could not hope to survi ][ ve.  Yet at the idea ][  ][ that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage an
d vengeance ][  ][ returned, and like a migh ][ ty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling. ][  ][ After a slight repose, during w
hich the spirits of the dead hovered ][  ][ roun ][ d and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey. ][  ][ I
 exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the  ][ inequalities of ][  ][ the frozen ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stoc
k of provisions, I ][  ][ departed from land. ][  ][ I c ][ annot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured
 ][  ][ misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a  ][ just retribution ][  ][ burning within my heart could have enabl
ed me to support.  Immense and ][  ][ rugged mountains of ice of ][ ten barred up my passage, and I often heard ][  ][ the thund
er of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.  But ][  ][ a ][ gain the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure
. ][  ][ By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should gue ][ ss that ][  ][ I had passed three weeks in this jour
ney; and the continual protraction ][  ][ of hope, returning back upon the h ][ eart, often wrung bitter drops of ][  ][ despond
ency and grief from my eyes.  Despair had indeed almost secured ][  ][ her prey, ][  and I should soon have sunk beneath this mi
sery.  Once, after ][  ][ the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil ][  gained the ][  ][ summit of a sloping i
ce mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, ][  ][ died, I viewed the expanse befor ][ e me with anguish, when suddenly my 
eye ][  ][ caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.  I strained my sight to ][  ][ discover ][  what it could be and uttered a 
wild cry of ecstasy when I ][  ][ distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well ][ -known ][  ][ form within.  
Oh!  With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart! ][  ][ Warm tears filled my eyes, which I h ][ astily wiped away, that 
they might ][  ][ not intercept the view I had of the daemon; but still my sight was ][  ][ dimmed by th ][ e burning drops, unt
il, giving way to the emotions that ][  ][ oppressed me, I wept aloud. ][  ][ But this was not the time for  ][ delay; I disencu
mbered the dogs of their ][  ][ dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an ][  ][ hour' ][ s rest, whic
h was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly ][  ][ irksome to me, I continued my route.  The sledge was s ][ till vis
ible, nor ][  ][ did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short ][  ][ time some ice-rock concealed ][  it 
with its intervening crags.  I indeed ][  ][ perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days' journey, I ][  ][ be ][ 
held my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within ][  ][ me. ][  ][ But now, when I appeared almost within g
 ][ rasp of my foe, my hopes were ][  ][ suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I ][  ][ had ever 
done ][  before.  A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its ][  ][ progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, becam
e every  ][ ][  ][ moment more ominous and terrific.  I pressed on, but in vain.  The wind ][  ][ arose; the sea roared; and, as
 with the mi ][ ghty shock of an earthquake, ][  ][ it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound.  The ][  ][ w
ork was soon fin ][ ished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled ][  ][ between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a
 scattered piece ][  ][  ][ of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a ][  ][ hideous death.  In this man
ner many appalling hours ][  passed; several of ][  ][ my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of ][
  ][ distress when I saw you ][ r vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to ][  ][ me hopes of succour and life.  I had no co
nception that vessels ever ][  ] ][ [ came so far north and was astounded at the sight.  I quickly destroyed ][  ][ part of my s
ledge to construct oars, and by thes ][ e means was enabled, ][  ][ with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction 
of your ][  ][ ship.  I had determined,  ][ if you were going southwards, still to trust ][  ][ myself to the mercy of the seas 
rather than abandon my purpose.  I ][  ][ ho ][ ped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my ][  ][ enemy. 
 But your direction was northwards.  You took me ][  on board when ][  ][ my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk u
nder my ][  ][ multiplied hardships into a death whi ][ ch I still dread, for my task is ][  ][ unfulfilled. ][  ][ Oh!  When wi
ll my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the daemon, al ][ low ][  ][ me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet l
ive?  If I do, ][  ][ swear to me, Walton, that he shall not ][  escape, that you will seek him ][  ][ and satisfy my vengeance 
in his death.  And do I dare to ask of you to ][  ][ undertake m ][ y pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?
 ][  ][ No; I am not so selfish.  Yet, when I am dead, if he should  ][ appear, if ][  ][ the ministers of vengeance should cond
uct him to you, swear that he ][  ][ shall not live--swear that he shall ][  not triumph over my accumulated ][  ][ woes and sur
vive to add to the list of his dark crimes.  He is eloquent ][  ][ and persu ][ asive, and once his words had even power over my
 heart; but ][  ][ trust him not.  His soul is as hellish as his form, full of t ][ reachery ][  ][ and fiend-like malice.  Hear
 him not; call on the names of William, ][  ][ Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my fathe ][ r, and of the wretched Victor, and ][  ]
[ thrust your sword into his heart.  I will hover near and direct the ][  ][ steel arigh ][ t. ][  ][                Walton, in 
continuation. ][  ][                                                 August 26th, 17-- ][  ] ][ [ You have read this strange and
 terrific story, Margaret; and do you not ][  ][ feel your blood congeal with horror, like that  ][ which even now curdles ][  ]
[ mine?  Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his ][  ][ tale; at others, his  ][ voice broken, yet pierci
ng, uttered with ][  ][ difficulty the words so replete with anguish.  His fine and lovely eyes ][  ][ w ][ ere now lighted up w
ith indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow ][  ][ and quenched in infinite wretchedness.  Sometimes he  ][ commanded his ][
  ][ countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a ][  ][ tranquil voice, suppressing eve ][ ry mark of a
gitation; then, like a ][  ][ volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression ][  ][ of the  ][ wildest 
rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor. ][  ][ His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the  ][ simp
lest ][  ][ truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he ][  ][ showed me, and the apparition of th ][ 
e monster seen from our ship, ][  ][ brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than ][  ][ his asseverati
 ][ ons, however earnest and connected.  Such a monster has, ][  ][ then, really existence!  I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in
 sur ][ prise ][  ][ and admiration.  Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the ][  ][ particulars of his creature's
 formati ][ on, but on this point he was ][  ][ impenetrable. "Are you mad, my friend?" said he.  "Or whither does your ][  ][ s
enseless cur ][ iosity lead you?  Would you also create for yourself and ][  ][ the world a demoniacal enemy?  Peace, peace!  Le
arn my miseries  ][ and do ][  ][ not seek to increase your own."  Frankenstein discovered that I made ][  ][ notes concerning h
is history; he asked ][  to see them and then himself ][  ][ corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giv
ing ][  ][ the life and  ][ spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. "Since ][  ][ you have preserved my narration," 
said he, "I would not that a ][  ][  ][ mutilated one should go down to posterity." ][  ][ Thus has a week passed away, while I 
have listened to the strangest ] ][ [  ][ tale that ever imagination formed.  My thoughts and every feeling of my ][  ][ soul ha
ve been drunk up by the interest for ][  my guest which this tale ][  ][ and his own elevated and gentle manners have created.  
I wish to soothe ][  ][ him, yet can I c ][ ounsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of ][  ][ every hope of consolation
, to live?  Oh, no!  The only joy that he ca ][ n ][  ][ now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and ][ 
 ][ death.  Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offsp ][ ring of solitude and ][  ][ delirium; he believes that when in dreams he hol
ds converse with his ][  ][ friends and derives from ][  that communion consolation for his miseries or ][  ][ excitements to hi
s vengeance, that they are not the creations of his ][   ][ ][ fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions o
f a ][  ][ remote world.  This faith gives a solemnity to hi ][ s reveries that render ][  ][ them to me almost as imposing and 
interesting as truth. ][  ][ Our conversations are not always co ][ nfined to his own history and ][  ][ misfortunes.  On every 
point of general literature he displays ][  ][ unbounded knowledge a ][ nd a quick and piercing apprehension.  His ][  ][ eloque
nce is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates ][  ][ ][  a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passi
ons of pity or love, ][  ][ without tears.  What a glorious creature must he ][  have been in the days ][  ][ of his prosperity,
 when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin!  He seems ][  ][ to feel his own wor ][ th and the greatness of his fall. ][  ][ "Wh
en younger," said he, "I believed myself destined for some great ][  ][ enterprise.  ][  My feelings are profound, but I possess
ed a  coolness of ][  ][ judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements.  This sen ][ timent ][  ][ of the worth of my nat
ure supported me when others would have been ][  ][ oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to t ][ hrow away in useless grief ][  ]
[ those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures.  When I ][  ][ reflected on the wor ][ k I had completed, no less a
 one than the creation ][  ][ of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the ] ][ [  ][ herd of common pro
jectors.  But this thought, which supported me in the ][  ][ commencement of my career, now serves only  ][ to plunge me lower i
n the ][  ][ dust.  All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the ][  ][ archangel who aspired  ][ to omnipotence, 
I am chained in an eternal hell. ][  ][ My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application ][   ][ ][ were inte
nse; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and ][  ][ executed the creation of a man.  Even now I can ][ not reco
llect without ][  ][ passion my reveries while the work was incomplete.  I trod heaven in my ][  ][ thoughts, now exulti ][ ng i
n my powers, now burning with the idea of their ][  ][ effects.  From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ][ ][ 
  ][ ambition; but how am I sunk!  Oh!  My friend, if you had known me as I ][  ][ once was, you would not recognize me in this 
 ][ state of degradation. ][  ][ Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me ][  ][ on, until I fell, 
neve ][ r, never again to rise."  Must I then lose this ][  ][ admirable being?  I have longed for a friend; I have sought one w
ho ][  ] ][ [ would sympathize with and love me.  Behold, on these desert seas I have ][  ][ found such a one, but I fear I have
 gained him  ][ only to know his value ][  ][ and lose him.  I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea. ][  ][ "I 
thank you, Walto ][ n," he said, "for your kind intentions towards so ][  ][ miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties 
and fresh ][  ][ aff ][ ections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?  Can any ][  ][ man be to me as Clerval was,
 or any woman another El ][ izabeth?  Even ][  ][ where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, ][  ][
 the companions of our child ][ hood always possess a certain power over our ][  ][ minds which hardly any later friend can obta
in.  They know our ][  ][ infant ][ ine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, ][  ][ are never eradicate
d; and they can judge of our actions ][  with more ][  ][ certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives.  A sister or a
 ][  ][ brother can never, unless indeed ][  such symptoms have been shown early, ][  ][ suspect the other of fraud or false dea
ling, when another friend, ][  ][ however st ][ rongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be ][  ][ contemplated with
 suspicion.  But I enjoyed friends, dear not onl ][ y ][  ][ through habit and association, but from their own merits; and where
ver ][  ][ I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth  ][ and the conversation of ][  ][ Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear.
 They are dead, and but one ][  ][ feeling in such a sol ][ itude can persuade me to preserve my life.  If I ][  ][ were engaged
 in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive ] ][ [  ][ utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfi
l it.  But ][  ][ such is not my destiny; I must pursue and dest ][ roy the being to whom I ][  ][ gave existence; then my lot o
n earth will be fulfilled and I may die." ][  ][ September 2nd ][  ] ][ [ My beloved Sister, ][  ][ I write to you, encompassed 
by peril and ignorant whether I am ever ][  ][ doomed to see again dear  ][ England and the dearer friends that inhabit ][  ][ i
t.  I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and ][  ][  ][ threaten every moment to crush my vessel.  The b
rave fellows whom I ][  ][ have persuaded to be my companions look towards me fo ][ r aid, but I have ][  ][ none to bestow.  Th
ere is something terribly appalling in our ][  ][ situation, yet my courage and hope ][ s do not desert me.  Yet it is ][  ][ te
rrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered ][  ][ through me.  If  ][ we are lost, my mad schemes are the 
cause. ][  ][ And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind?  You will not hear ][  ][  ][ of my destruction, and you will 
anxiously await my return.  Years will ][  ][ pass, and you will have visitings of despair and y ][ et be tortured by ][  ][ hop
e.  Oh!  My beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt ][  ][ expectations is, in pros ][ pect, more terrible to m
e than my own death. ][  ][ But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy.  Heaven ][  ][ ][  bless you and make 
you so! ][  ][ My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion.  He ][  ][ endeavours to fill  ][ me with hope and
 talks as if life were a possession ][  ][ which he valued.  He reminds me how often the same accidents have ][  ][  ][ happened
 to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite ][  ][ of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. ][   Even t
he sailors feel ][  ][ the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he ][  ][ rouses their energi ][ es, 
and while they hear his voice they believe these ][  ][ vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the ][ ][ 
  ][ resolutions of man.  These feelings are transitory; each day of ][  ][ expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almo
 ][ st dread a mutiny ][  ][ caused by this despair. ][  ][ September 5th ][  ][ A scene has just passed of such uncommon intere
st t ][ hat, although it is ][  ][ highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot ][  ][ forbear recording 
it. ][   ][ ][ We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger ][  ][ of being crushed in their conflict. 
 The cold is ][  excessive, and many of ][  ][ my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of ][  ][ de
solation.  Frank ][ enstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire ][  ][ still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted
, and when suddenly  ][ ][  ][ roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent ][  ][ lifelessness. ][  ][ I menti
oned in my last letter t ][ he fears I entertained of a mutiny. ][  ][ This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my
 friend--his ][  ][ eyes hal ][ f closed and his limbs hanging listlessly--I was roused by half ][  ][ a dozen of the sailors, w
ho demanded admission into the c ][ abin.  They ][  ][ entered, and their leader addressed me.  He told me that he and his ][  ]
[ companions had been chosen by the  ][ other sailors to come in deputation ][  ][ to me to make me a requisition which, in just
ice, I could not refuse. ][  ][ We were  ][ immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they ][  ][ feared that if, as 
was possible, the ice should dissipate and a ][  free ][  ][ passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage an
d ][  ][ lead them into fresh dangers, after the ][ y might happily have surmounted ][  ][ this.  They insisted, therefore, that
 I should engage with a solemn ][  ][ promise that i ][ f the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my ][  ][ course s
outhwards. ][  ][ This speech troubled me.  I had not de ][ spaired, nor had I yet conceived ][  ][ the idea of returning if set
 free.  Yet could I, in justice, or even in ][  ][ possibili ][ ty, refuse this demand?  I hesitated before I answered, when ][ 
 ][ Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appea ][ red hardly ][  ][ to have force enough to attend, now roused
 himself; his eyes sparkled, ][  ][ and his cheeks flushed with mome ][ ntary vigour.  Turning towards the men, ][  ][ he said, 
"What do you mean?  What do you demand of your captain?  Are ][  ][ you, ][  then, so easily turned from your design?  Did you n
ot call this a ][  ][ glorious expedition? ][  ][ "And wherefore was it glor ][ ious?  Not because the way was smooth and ][  ][
 placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and ][  ][ terror, ][  because at every new incident your fortitud
e was to be called ][  ][ forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death ][  surrounded ][  ][ it, and these you wer
e to brave and overcome.  For this was it a ][  ][ glorious, for this was it an honourab ][ le undertaking.  You were ][  ][ her
eafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names ][  ][ adored as belongin ][ g to brave men who encountered d
eath for honour and ][  ][ the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the first imagination o ][ f ][  ][ danger, or, if you 
will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your ][  ][ courage, you shrink away and are content to ][  be handed down as men w
ho ][  ][ had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, ][  ][ they were chilly  ][ and returned to thei
r warm firesides.  Why, that ][  ][ requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and ][  ][ ][  dragged your ca
ptain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove ][  ][ yourselves cowards.  Oh!  Be men, or be more than men.  Be ][  steady to ]
[  ][ your purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as ][  ][ your hearts may be; it is mutab ][ le and c
annot withstand you if you say ][  ][ that it shall not.  Do not return to your families with the stigma of ][  ][ disgr ][ ace 
marked on your brows.  Return as heroes who have fought and ][  ][ conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs ][ 
 on the foe." ][  ][ He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings ][  ][ expressed in his speech, with an e
 ][ ye so full of lofty design and ][  ][ heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved?  They looked at ][  ][ one ano
ther ][  and were unable to reply.  I spoke; I told them to retire ][  ][ and consider of what had been said, that I would not l
ead them ][  farther ][  ][ north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, ][  ][ with reflection, their
 courage wou ][ ld return.  They retired and I turned ][  ][ towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived o
f ][  ][ life. ] ][ [  ][ How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than ][  ][ return shamefully, my purpos
e unfulfilled.  Yet  ][ I fear such will be my ][  ][ fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never ][  ][ 
willingly continue to en ][ dure their present hardships. ][  ][ September 7th ][  ][ The die is cast; I have consented to retur
n if we are not destroyed. ] ][ [  ][ Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ][  ][ ignorant and dis
appointed.  It requires more phi ][ losophy than I possess ][  ][ to bear this injustice with patience. ][  ][ September 12th ][
  ][ It is past; I am returning to E ][ ngland.  I have lost my hopes of utility ][  ][ and glory; I have lost my friend.  But I
 will endeavour to detail these ][  ][ b ][ itter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted ][  ][ towards Eng
land and towards you, I will not despond. ][ ][   ][ September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were ][  ][
 heard at a distance as the islands split and cr ][ acked in every ][  ][ direction.  We were in the most imminent peril, but as
 we could only ][  ][ remain passive, my chief atten ][ tion was occupied by my unfortunate guest ][  ][ whose illness increased
 in such a degree that he was entirely confined ][  ][ t ][ o his bed.  The ice cracked behind us and was driven with force ][  
][ towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on  ][ the 11th the ][  ][ passage towards the south became perfectly f
ree.  When the sailors saw ][  ][ this and that their return to  ][ their native country was apparently ][  ][ assured, a shout 
of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and ][  ][ long-continued.   ][ Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the ][  ][
 cause of the tumult.  "They shout," I said, "because they will soon ][  ][  ][ return to England." ][  ][ "Do you, then, really
 return?" ][  ][ "Alas!  Yes; I cannot withstand their demands.  I cannot le ][ ad them ][  ][ unwillingly to danger, and I must
 return." ][  ][ "Do so, if you will; but I will not.  You may give up your purp ][ ose, but ][  ][ mine is assigned to me by he
aven, and I dare not.  I am weak, but ][  ][ surely the spirits who assist my vengea ][ nce will endow me with ][  ][ sufficient
 strength."  Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the ][  ][ bed, but the exertion ][  was too great for him; he fell back
 and fainted. ][  ][ It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was ] ][ [  ][ entirely extinct.  At leng
th he opened his eyes; he breathed with ][  ][ difficulty and was unable to speak.  The surgeon  ][ gave him a composing ][  ][ 
draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he ][  ][ told me that my friend ha ][ d certainly not many hou
rs to live. ][  ][ His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient.  I ][  ][ sat by ][  his bed, watching h
im; his eyes were closed, and I thought he ][  ][ slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, an ][ d bidding me ][ 
 ][ come near, said, "Alas!  The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that ][  ][ I shall soon die, and he, my e ][ nemy and per
secutor, may still be in ][  ][ being.  Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I ][  ][ feel th ][ at burni
ng hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; ][  ][ but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my  ][ adve
rsary. ][  ][ During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past ][  ][ conduct; nor do I find it blamable.  I ][ 
n a fit of enthusiastic madness I ][  ][ created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far ][  ][ as was i
 ][ n my power, his happiness and well-being. ][  ][ "This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that.  My ][  ]
[ du ][ ties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my ][  ][ attention because they included a greater prop
ortion o ][ f happiness or ][  ][ misery.  Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to ][  ][ create a compan
ion for the  ][ first creature.  He showed unparalleled ][  ][ malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he de
voted ][  ][ to  ][ destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, ][  ][ and wisdom; nor do I know where thi
s thirst for vengean ][ ce may end. ][  ][ Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to ][  ][ die.  The 
task of his destruction  ][ was mine, but I have failed.  When ][  ][ actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to un
dertake my ][  ][ unfinished ][  work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced ][  ][ by reason and virtue. ][  ][ 
"Yet I cannot ask you to renounc ][ e your country and friends to fulfil ][  ][ this task; and now that you are returning to Eng
land, you will have ][  ][ little ch ][ ance of meeting with him.  But the consideration of these ][  ][ points, and the well ba
lancing of what you may esteem your duti ][ es, I ][  ][ leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near ]
[  ][ approach of death.  I dare not ask you ][  to do what I think right, for I ][  ][ may still be misled by passion. ][  ][ "
That he should live to be an instrument of misch ][ ief disturbs me; in ][  ][ other respects, this hour, when I momentarily exp
ect my release, is the ][  ][ only happy one which I ][  have enjoyed for several years.  The forms of ][  ][ the beloved dead f
lit before me, and I hasten to their arms.  Farewell, ][ ][   ][ Walton!  Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, eve
n if it ][  ][ be only the apparently innocent one of distin ][ guishing yourself in ][  ][ science and discoveries.  Yet why do
 I say this?  I have myself been ][  ][ blasted in these hopes,  ][ yet another may succeed." ][  ][ His voice became fainter as
 he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his ][  ][ effort, he sank in ][ to silence.  About half an hour afterwards he ][  ][ att
empted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and ][  ][  ][ his eyes closed forever, while the irradiation o
f a gentle smile passed ][  ][ away from his lips. ][  ][ Margaret, what com ][ ment can I make on the untimely extinction of th
is ][  ][ glorious spirit?  What can I say that will enable you to understand th ][ e ][  ][ depth of my sorrow?  All that I sho
uld express would be inadequate and ][  ][ feeble.  My tears flow; my mind is oversh ][ adowed by a cloud of ][  ][ disappointme
nt.  But I journey towards England, and I may there find ][  ][ consolation. ][  ][ I am ][  interrupted.  What do these sounds 
portend?  It is midnight; the ][  ][ breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely sti ][ r.  Again there ][  ][ is a soun
d as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin ][  ][ where the remains of Frankens ][ tein still lie.  I must aris
e and examine. ][  ][ Good night, my sister. ][  ][ Great God! what a scene has just taken place!  I ][  am yet dizzy with the ]
[  ][ remembrance of it.  I hardly know whether I shall have the power to ][  ][ detail it; yet the tale ][  which I have record
ed would be incomplete ][  ][ without this final and wonderful catastrophe. I entered the cabin where ][  ][ ][  lay the remains
 of my ill-fated and admirable friend.  Over him hung a ][  ][ form which I cannot find words to describe--gigan ][ tic in statu
re, yet ][  ][ uncouth and distorted in its proportions.  As he hung over the coffin, ][  ][ his face was concealed  ][ by long 
locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand ][  ][ was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When ] ][ [  ]
[ he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of ][  ][ grief and horror and sprung towards the windo ][ 
w.  Never did I behold a ][  ][ vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling ][  ][ hideousness.  I shut my e
 ][ yes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect ][  ][ what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.  I called on him to
 ][  ][  ][ stay. ][  ][ He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the ][  ][ lifeless form of his creator
, he see ][ med to forget my presence, and ][  ][ every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some ][  ][
 uncontrolla ][ ble passion. ][  ][ "That is also my victim!" he exclaimed.  "In his murder my crimes are ][  ][ consummated; th
e miserable seri ][ es of my being is wound to its close! ][  ][ Oh, Frankenstein!  Generous and self-devoted being!  What does 
it avail ][  ][ that ][  I now ask thee to pardon me?  I, who irretrievably destroyed thee ][  ][ by destroying all thou lovedst
.  Alas!  He is cold, he ][  cannot answer ][  ][ me." His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had ][  ][ sugg
ested to me the duty of obey ][ ing the dying request of my friend in ][  ][ destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixtu
re of curiosity and ][  ][ compa ][ ssion.  I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again ][  ][ raise my eyes to his fa
ce, there was something so scaring a ][ nd unearthly ][  ][ in his ugliness.  I attempted to speak, but the words died away on m
y ][  ][ lips.  The monster continued to ][  utter wild and incoherent ][  ][ self-reproaches.  At length I gathered resolution 
to address him in a ][  ][ pause of the temp ][ est of his passion. ][  ][ "Your repentance," I said, "is now superfluous. If yo
u had listened to ][  ][ the voice of conscience ][  and heeded the stings of remorse before you had ][  ][ urged your diabolica
l vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would ][ ][   ][ yet have lived." ][  ][ "And do you dream?" said the daemon.  "Do y
ou think that I was then ][  ][ dead to agony and remors ][ e?  He," he continued, pointing to the corpse, ][  ][ "he suffered n
ot in the consummation of the deed. Oh!  Not the ][  ][ ten- ][ thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the ][  ]
[ lingering detail of its execution.  A frightful selfishness hu ][ rried me ][  ][ on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse
.  Think you that the ][  ][ groans of Clerval were music to my ears ][ ?  My heart was fashioned to be ][  ][ susceptible of lo
ve and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice ][  ][ and hatred,  ][ it did not endure the violence of the change without
 ][  ][ torture such as you cannot even imagine. ][  ][ "After the murder of ][  Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken
 ][  ][ and overcome.  I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I ][   ][ ][ abhorred myself.  But when I discovered t
hat he, the author at once of ][  ][ my existence and of its unspeakable torments, d ][ ared to hope for ][  ][ happiness, that 
while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me ][  ][ he sought his own enjoyment ][  in feelings and passions from the ]
[  ][ indulgence of which I was forever barred, then impotent envy and bitter ][  ][ indigna ][ tion filled me with an insatiabl
e thirst for vengeance.  I ][  ][ recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplis ][ hed.  I ][  ][ knew that I w
as preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the ][  ][ slave, not the master, of an impulse  ][ which I detested yet cou
ld not ][  ][ disobey.  Yet when she died!  Nay, then I was not miserable.  I had ][  ][ cast off all fe ][ eling, subdued all a
nguish, to riot in the excess of my ][  ][ despair.  Evil thenceforth became my good.  Urged thus far, I had ][  no ][  ][ choic
e but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly ][  ][ chosen.  The completion of my demoniacal des ][ ign became a
n insatiable ][  ][ passion.  And now it is ended; there is my last victim!" ][  ][ I was at first touched by the ex ][ pression
s of his misery; yet, when I ][  ][ called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence ][  ][ and pers ][ uasi
on, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of ][  ][ my friend, indignation was rekindled within me.  "Wretch!"  ][ 
I said.  "It ][  ][ is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have ][  ][ made.  You throw a torch into a
 ][  pile of buildings, and when they are ][  ][ consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall.  Hypocritical ][  ][ fie
nd!  ][  If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, ][  ][ again would he become the prey, of your accursed
 vengean ][ ce.  It is not ][  ][ pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your ][  ][ malignity is withdrawn f
rom your pow ][ er." ][  ][ "Oh, it is not thus--not thus," interrupted the being.  "Yet such must ][  ][ be the impression conv
eyed to you by w ][ hat appears to be the purport of ][  ][ my actions.  Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.  No sympa
thy ][  ][ may I eve ][ r find.  When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, ][  ][ the feelings of happiness and affecti
on with which my whole b ][ eing ][  ][ overflowed, that I wished to be participated.  But now that virtue has ][  ][ become to 
me a shadow, and that happin ][ ess and affection are turned into ][  ][ bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for 
sympathy?  I am ][  ][ content t ][ o suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I ][  ][ am well satisfied that
 abhorrence and opprobrium should lo ][ ad my memory. ][  ][ Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of ][
  ][ enjoyment.  Once I falsely hoped to ][  meet with beings who, pardoning my ][  ][ outward form, would love me for the excel
lent qualities which I was ][  ][ capable of ][  unfolding.  I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and ][  ][ devotion.  
But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanes ][ t animal. No ][  ][ guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be foun
d comparable to ][  ][ mine.  When I run over the fr ][ ightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot ][  ][ believe that I am the same
 creature whose thoughts were once filled ][  ][ with su ][ blime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of ][  
][ goodness.  But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a  ][ malignant ][  ][ devil.  Yet even that enemy of God and man had 
friends and associates ][  ][ in his desolation; I am alone. ][  ][  ][ "You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a 
knowledge of my ][  ][ crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail ][  which he gave you of them ][  ][ he could not sum up th
e hours and months of misery which I endured ][  ][ wasting in impotent  ][ passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did ][ 
 ][ not satisfy my own desires. They were forever ardent and craving; still  ][ ][  ][ I desired love and fellowship, and I was 
still spurned.  Was there no ][  ][ injustice in this? Am I to be thought the on ][ ly criminal, when all ][  ][ humankind sinne
d against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his ][  ][ friend from his door w ][ ith contumely? Why do you not execrate t
he rustic ][  ][ who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous ][  ][  ][ and immaculate beings! I, th
e miserable and the abandoned, am an ][  ][ abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and tram ][ pled on. Even now my ][  ][ bloo
d boils at the recollection of this injustice. ][  ][ "But it is true that I am a wretch.  I hav ][ e murdered the lovely and th
e ][  ][ helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to ][  ][ death his throa ][ t who never injured me o
r any other living thing.  I ][  ][ have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy o ][ f ][  ][ love and ad
miration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to ][  ][ that irremediable ruin. ][  ][ "There he li ][ es, white and co
ld in death.  You hate me, but your ][  ][ abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself.  I look on t ][ he ][  ][ ha
nds which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the ][  ][ imagination of it was conceived and long for t ][ he momen
t when these ][  ][ hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts ][  ][ no more. ][  ][ "Fear n ][ ot t
hat I shall be the instrument of future mischief.  My work ][  ][ is nearly complete.  Neither yours nor any man's death is  ][ 
needed to ][  ][ consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be ][  ][ done, but it requires my own.  Do no
 ][ t think that I shall be slow to ][  ][ perform this sacrifice.  I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which ][  ][ brough
t me ][  thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the ][  ][ globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to 
ashes th ][ is ][  ][ miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious ][  ][ and unhallowed wretch who woul
d create suc ][ h another as I have been.  I ][  ][ shall die.  I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or ][  ]
[ be the prey of ][  feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched.  He is dead who ][  ][ called me into being; and when I shall be no m
ore, the very rememb ][ rance ][  ][ of us both will speedily vanish.  I shall no longer see the sun or ][  ][ stars or feel the
 winds play on my cheeks ][ . ][  ][ "Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I ][  ][ find my happ
iness.  Some years ago, when ][  the images which this world ][  ][ affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmt
h of summer ][  ][ and heard the ][  rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and ][  ][ these were all to me, I sh
ould have wept to die; now it is my  ][ only ][  ][ consolation.  Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, ][  ][ w
here can I find rest but in death? ][  ] ][ [ "Farewell!  I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these ][  ][ eyes w
ill ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If  ][ thou wert yet alive ][  ][ and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it 
would be better ][  ][ satiated in my life than  ][ in my destruction. But it was not so; thou ][  ][ didst seek my extinction, 
that I might not cause greater wretchedness; ][  ][  ][ and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think ]
[  ][ and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a ven ][ geance greater than ][  ][ that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, 
my agony was still superior to ][  ][ thine, for the bitter  ][ sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my ][  ][ wounds un
til death shall close them forever. ][  ][ "But soon," he cried  ][ with sad and solemn enthusiasm, "I shall die, and ][  ][ wha
t I now feel be no longer felt.  Soon these burning miseries will be ][  ][  ][ extinct.  I shall ascend my funeral pile triumph
antly and exult in the ][  ][ agony of the torturing flames. The light o ][ f that conflagration will ][  ][ fade away; my ashes
 will be swept into the sea by the winds.  My spirit ][  ][ will sleep in pe ][ ace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think t
hus. ][  ][ Farewell." ][  ][ He sprang from the cabin window as he said this, u ][ pon the ice raft ][  ][ which lay close to t
he vessel.  He was soon borne away by the waves and ][  ][ lost in darkness and dist ][ ance. ][  ][
