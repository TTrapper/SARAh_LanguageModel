Data should be ascii or otherwise encode 1 byte per character: Tensorflow's string_split doesn't play nice otherwise.
Lines must have the same number of characters. If variable lengths sequences are desired they must be padded to a fixed length.
The source/target pairs are selected by choosing concurrent lines, so each line is considered the target for the previous line.
The files in 'example_data/processed/' can be generated by running:

    python --src example_data/processed/ --dst /example_data/unprocessed --seq_len 64
