[  ][ PREFACE ][  ][  (December, 1916) ][  ][ The present book i
s intended, as far as possible, to give an exact ][  ][ insight 
into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a ][  ]
[ general scientific and philosophical point of view, are intere
sted in ][  ][ the theory, but who are not conversant with the m
athematical apparatus ][  ][ of theoretical physics. The work pr
esumes a standard of education ][  ][ corresponding to that of a
 university matriculation examination, and, ][  ][ despite the s
hortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force ][  ][
 of will on the part of the reader. The author has spared himsel
f no ][  ][ pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in 
the simplest and ][  ][ most intelligible form, and on the whole
, in the sequence and ][  ][ connection in which they actually o
riginated. In the interest of ][  ][ clearness, it appeared to m
e inevitable that I should repeat myself ][  ][ frequently, with
out paying the slightest attention to the elegance of ][  ][ the
 presentation. I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that ][ 
 ][ brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to w
hom ][  ][ matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor an
d to the cobbler. ][  ][ I make no pretence of having withheld f
rom the reader difficulties ][  ][ which are inherent to the sub
ject. On the other hand, I have purposely ][  ][ treated the emp
irical physical foundations of the theory in a ][  ][ "step-moth
erly" fashion, so that readers unfamiliar with physics may ][  ]
[ not feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the forest fo
r the ][  ][ trees. May the book bring some one a few happy hour
s of suggestive ][  ][ thought! ][  ][ December, 1916 ][  ][ A. 
EINSTEIN ][  ][ PART I ][  ][ THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ]
[  ][ PHYSICAL MEANING OF GEOMETRICAL PROPOSITIONS ][  ][ In you
r schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance ][
  ][ with the noble building of Euclid's geometry, and you remem
ber -- ][  ][ perhaps with more respect than love -- the magnifi
cent structure, on ][  ][ the lofty staircase of which you were 
chased about for uncounted hours ][  ][ by conscientious teacher
s. By reason of our past experience, you would ][  ][ certainly 
regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the ][  ]
[ most out-of-the-way proposition of this science to be untrue. 
But ][  ][ perhaps this feeling of proud certainty would leave y
ou immediately if ][  ][ some one were to ask you: "What, then, 
do you mean by the assertion ][  ][ that these propositions are 
true?" Let us proceed to give this ][  ][ question a little cons
ideration. ][  ][ Geometry sets out form certain conceptions suc
h as "plane," "point," ][  ][ and "straight line," with which we
 are able to associate more or less ][  ][ definite ideas, and f
rom certain simple propositions (axioms) which, ][  ][ in virtue
 of these ideas, we are inclined to accept as "true." Then, ][  
][ on the basis of a logical process, the justification of which
 we feel ][  ][ ourselves compelled to admit, all remaining prop
ositions are shown to ][  ][ follow from those axioms, i.e. they
 are proven. A proposition is then ][  ][ correct ("true") when 
it has been derived in the recognised manner ][  ][ from the axi
oms. The question of "truth" of the individual geometrical ][  ]
[ propositions is thus reduced to one of the "truth" of the axio
ms. Now ][  ][ it has long been known that the last question is 
not only unanswerable ][  ][ by the methods of geometry, but tha
t it is in itself entirely without ][  ][ meaning. We cannot ask
 whether it is true that only one straight line ][  ][ goes thro
ugh two points. We can only say that Euclidean geometry deals ][
  ][ with things called "straight lines," to each of which is as
cribed the ][  ][ property of being uniquely determined by two p
oints situated on it. ][  ][ The concept "true" does not tally w
ith the assertions of pure ][  ][ geometry, because by the word 
"true" we are eventually in the habit of ][  ][ designating alwa
ys the correspondence with a "real" object; geometry, ][  ][ how
ever, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved i
n ][  ][ it to objects of experience, but only with the logical 
connection of ][  ][ these ideas among themselves. ][  ][ It is 
not difficult to understand why, in spite of this, we feel ][  ]
[ constrained to call the propositions of geometry "true." Geome
trical ][  ][ ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in 
nature, and these ][  ][ last are undoubtedly the exclusive caus
e of the genesis of those ][  ][ ideas. Geometry ought to refrai
n from such a course, in order to give ][  ][ to its structure t
he largest possible logical unity. The practice, for ][  ][ exam
ple, of seeing in a "distance" two marked positions on a ][  ][ 
practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in ou
r ][  ][ habit of thought. We are accustomed further to regard t
hree points as ][  ][ being situated on a straight line, if thei
r apparent positions can be ][  ][ made to coincide for observat
ion with one eye, under suitable choice ][  ][ of our place of o
bservation. ][  ][ If, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we 
now supplement the ][  ][ propositions of Euclidean geometry by 
the single proposition that two ][  ][ points on a practically r
igid body always correspond to the same ][  ][ distance (line-in
terval), independently of any changes in position to ][  ][ whic
h we may subject the body, the propositions of Euclidean geometr
y ][  ][ then resolve themselves into propositions on the possib
le relative ][  ][ position of practically rigid bodies.* Geomet
ry which has been ][  ][ supplemented in this way is then to be 
treated as a branch of physics. ][  ][ We can now legitimately a
sk as to the "truth" of geometrical ][  ][ propositions interpre
ted in this way, since we are justified in asking ][  ][ whether
 these propositions are satisfied for those real things we have 
][  ][ associated with the geometrical ideas. In less exact term
s we can ][  ][ express this by saying that by the "truth" of a 
geometrical ][  ][ proposition in this sense we understand its v
alidity for a ][  ][ construction with rule and compasses. ][  ]
[ Of course the conviction of the "truth" of geometrical proposi
tions in ][  ][ this sense is founded exclusively on rather inco
mplete experience. For ][  ][ the present we shall assume the "t
ruth" of the geometrical ][  ][ propositions, then at a later st
age (in the general theory of ][  ][ relativity) we shall see th
at this "truth" is limited, and we shall ][  ][ consider the ext
ent of its limitation. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) It follows that 
a natural object is associated also with a ][  ][ straight line.
 Three points A, B and C on a rigid body thus lie in a ][  ][ st
raight line when the points A and C being given, B is chosen suc
h ][  ][ that the sum of the distances AB and BC is as short as 
possible. This ][  ][ incomplete suggestion will suffice for the
 present purpose. ][  ][ THE SYSTEM OF CO-ORDINATES ][  ][ On th
e basis of the physical interpretation of distance which has bee
n ][  ][ indicated, we are also in a position to establish the d
istance between ][  ][ two points on a rigid body by means of me
asurements. For this purpose ][  ][ we require a " distance " (r
od S) which is to be used once and for ][  ][ all, and which we 
employ as a standard measure. If, now, A and B are ][  ][ two po
ints on a rigid body, we can construct the line joining them ][ 
 ][ according to the rules of geometry ; then, starting from A, 
we can ][  ][ mark off the distance S time after time until we r
each B. The number ][  ][ of these operations required is the nu
merical measure of the distance ][  ][ AB. This is the basis of 
all measurement of length. * ][  ][ Every description of the sce
ne of an event or of the position of an ][  ][ object in space i
s based on the specification of the point on a rigid ][  ][ body
 (body of reference) with which that event or object coincides. 
][  ][ This applies not only to scientific description, but also
 to everyday ][  ][ life. If I analyse the place specification "
 Times Square, New York," ][  ][ **A I arrive at the following r
esult. The earth is the rigid body ][  ][ to which the specifica
tion of place refers; " Times Square, New York," ][  ][ is a wel
l-defined point, to which a name has been assigned, and with ][ 
 ][ which the event coincides in space.**B ][  ][ This primitive
 method of place specification deals only with places on ][  ][ 
the surface of rigid bodies, and is dependent on the existence o
f ][  ][ points on this surface which are distinguishable from e
ach other. But ][  ][ we can free ourselves from both of these l
imitations without altering ][  ][ the nature of our specificati
on of position. If, for instance, a cloud ][  ][ is hovering ove
r Times Square, then we can determine its position ][  ][ relati
ve to the surface of the earth by erecting a pole ][  ][ perpend
icularly on the Square, so that it reaches the cloud. The ][  ][
 length of the pole measured with the standard measuring-rod, co
mbined ][  ][ with the specification of the position of the foot
 of the pole, ][  ][ supplies us with a complete place specifica
tion. On the basis of this ][  ][ illustration, we are able to s
ee the manner in which a refinement of ][  ][ the conception of 
position has been developed. ][  ][ (a) We imagine the rigid bod
y, to which the place specification is ][  ][ referred, suppleme
nted in such a manner that the object whose position ][  ][ we r
equire is reached by. the completed rigid body. ][  ][ (b) In lo
cating the position of the object, we make use of a number ][  ]
[ (here the length of the pole measured with the measuring-rod) 
instead ][  ][ of designated points of reference. ][  ][ (c) We 
speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole which ][  ][
 reaches the cloud has not been erected. By means of optical ][ 
 ][ observations of the cloud from different positions on the gr
ound, and ][  ][ taking into account the properties of the propa
gation of light, we ][  ][ determine the length of the pole we s
hould have required in order to ][  ][ reach the cloud. ][  ][ F
rom this consideration we see that it will be advantageous if, i
n the ][  ][ description of position, it should be possible by m
eans of numerical ][  ][ measures to make ourselves independent 
of the existence of marked ][  ][ positions (possessing names) o
n the rigid body of reference. In the ][  ][ physics of measurem
ent this is attained by the application of the ][  ][ Cartesian 
system of co-ordinates. ][  ][ This consists of three plane surf
aces perpendicular to each other and ][  ][ rigidly attached to 
a rigid body. Referred to a system of ][  ][ co-ordinates, the s
cene of any event will be determined (for the main ][  ][ part) 
by the specification of the lengths of the three perpendiculars 
][  ][ or co-ordinates (x, y, z) which can be dropped from the s
cene of the ][  ][ event to those three plane surfaces. The leng
ths of these three ][  ][ perpendiculars can be determined by a 
series of manipulations with ][  ][ rigid measuring-rods perform
ed according to the rules and methods laid ][  ][ down by Euclid
ean geometry. ][  ][ In practice, the rigid surfaces which const
itute the system of ][  ][ co-ordinates are generally not availa
ble ; furthermore, the magnitudes ][  ][ of the co-ordinates are
 not actually determined by constructions with ][  ][ rigid rods
, but by indirect means. If the results of physics and ][  ][ as
tronomy are to maintain their clearness, the physical meaning of
 ][  ][ specifications of position must always be sought in acco
rdance with ][  ][ the above considerations. *** ][  ][ We thus 
obtain the following result: Every description of events in ][  
][ space involves the use of a rigid body to which such events h
ave to be ][  ][ referred. The resulting relationship takes for 
granted that the laws ][  ][ of Euclidean geometry hold for "dis
tances;" the "distance" being ][  ][ represented physically by m
eans of the convention of two marks on a ][  ][ rigid body. ][  
][   Notes ][  ][ * Here we have assumed that there is nothing l
eft over i.e. that ][  ][ the measurement gives a whole number. 
This difficulty is got over by ][  ][ the use of divided measuri
ng-rods, the introduction of which does not ][  ][ demand any fu
ndamentally new method. ][  ][ **A Einstein used "Potsdamer Plat
z, Berlin" in the original text. ][  ][ In the authorised transl
ation this was supplemented with "Tranfalgar ][  ][ Square, Lond
on". We have changed this to "Times Square, New York", as ][  ][
 this is the most well known/identifiable location to English sp
eakers ][  ][ in the present day. [Note by the janitor.] ][  ][ 
**B It is not necessary here to investigate further the signific
ance ][  ][ of the expression "coincidence in space." This conce
ption is ][  ][ sufficiently obvious to ensure that differences 
of opinion are ][  ][ scarcely likely to arise as to its applica
bility in practice. ][  ][ *** A refinement and modification of 
these views does not become ][  ][ necessary until we come to de
al with the general theory of relativity, ][  ][ treated in the 
second part of this book. ][  ][ SPACE AND TIME IN CLASSICAL MEC
HANICS ][  ][ The purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies
 change their ][  ][ position in space with "time." I should loa
d my conscience with grave ][  ][ sins against the sacred spirit
 of lucidity were I to formulate the ][  ][ aims of mechanics in
 this way, without serious reflection and detailed ][  ][ explan
ations. Let us proceed to disclose these sins. ][  ][ It is not 
clear what is to be understood here by "position" and ][  ][ "sp
ace." I stand at the window of a railway carriage which is ][  ]
[ travelling uniformly, and drop a stone on the embankment, with
out ][  ][ throwing it. Then, disregarding the influence of the 
air resistance, I ][  ][ see the stone descend in a straight lin
e. A pedestrian who observes ][  ][ the misdeed from the footpat
h notices that the stone falls to earth in ][  ][ a parabolic cu
rve. I now ask: Do the "positions" traversed by the ][  ][ stone
 lie "in reality" on a straight line or on a parabola? Moreover,
 ][  ][ what is meant here by motion "in space" ? From the consi
derations of ][  ][ the previous section the answer is self-evid
ent. In the first place we ][  ][ entirely shun the vague word "
space," of which, we must honestly ][  ][ acknowledge, we cannot
 form the slightest conception, and we replace ][  ][ it by "mot
ion relative to a practically rigid body of reference." The ][  
][ positions relative to the body of reference (railway carriage
 or ][  ][ embankment) have already been defined in detail in th
e preceding ][  ][ section. If instead of " body of reference " 
we insert " system of ][  ][ co-ordinates," which is a useful id
ea for mathematical description, we ][  ][ are in a position to 
say : The stone traverses a straight line ][  ][ relative to a s
ystem of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the carriage, ][  ][ b
ut relative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the 
][  ][ ground (embankment) it describes a parabola. With the aid
 of this ][  ][ example it is clearly seen that there is no such
 thing as an ][  ][ independently existing trajectory (lit. "pat
h-curve"*), but only ][  ][ a trajectory relative to a particula
r body of reference. ][  ][ In order to have a complete descript
ion of the motion, we must specify ][  ][ how the body alters it
s position with time ; i.e. for every point on ][  ][ the trajec
tory it must be stated at what time the body is situated ][  ][ 
there. These data must be supplemented by such a definition of t
ime ][  ][ that, in virtue of this definition, these time-values
 can be regarded ][  ][ essentially as magnitudes (results of me
asurements) capable of ][  ][ observation. If we take our stand 
on the ground of classical ][  ][ mechanics, we can satisfy this
 requirement for our illustration in the ][  ][ following manner
. We imagine two clocks of identical construction ; ][  ][ the m
an at the railway-carriage window is holding one of them, and th
e ][  ][ man on the footpath the other. Each of the observers de
termines the ][  ][ position on his own reference-body occupied 
by the stone at each tick ][  ][ of the clock he is holding in h
is hand. In this connection we have not ][  ][ taken account of 
the inaccuracy involved by the finiteness of the ][  ][ velocity
 of propagation of light. With this and with a second ][  ][ dif
ficulty prevailing here we shall have to deal in detail later. ]
[  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) That is, a curve along which the body mo
ves. ][  ][ THE GALILEIAN SYSTEM OF CO-ORDINATES ][  ][ As is we
ll known, the fundamental law of the mechanics of ][  ][ Galilei
-Newton, which is known as the law of inertia, can be stated ][ 
 ][ thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies cont
inues in a ][  ][ state of rest or of uniform motion in a straig
ht line. This law not ][  ][ only says something about the motio
n of the bodies, but it also ][  ][ indicates the reference-bodi
es or systems of coordinates, permissible ][  ][ in mechanics, w
hich can be used in mechanical description. The visible ][  ][ f
ixed stars are bodies for which the law of inertia certainly hol
ds to ][  ][ a high degree of approximation. Now if we use a sys
tem of co-ordinates ][  ][ which is rigidly attached to the eart
h, then, relative to this system, ][  ][ every fixed star descri
bes a circle of immense radius in the course of ][  ][ an astron
omical day, a result which is opposed to the statement of the ][
  ][ law of inertia. So that if we adhere to this law we must re
fer these ][  ][ motions only to systems of coordinates relative
 to which the fixed ][  ][ stars do not move in a circle. A syst
em of co-ordinates of which the ][  ][ state of motion is such t
hat the law of inertia holds relative to it ][  ][ is called a "
 Galileian system of co-ordinates." The laws of the ][  ][ mecha
nics of Galflei-Newton can be regarded as valid only for a ][  ]
[ Galileian system of co-ordinates. ][  ][ THE PRINCIPLE OF RELA
TIVITY ][  ][ (IN THE RESTRICTED SENSE) ][  ][ In order to attai
n the greatest possible clearness, let us return to ][  ][ our e
xample of the railway carriage supposed to be travelling ][  ][ 
uniformly. We call its motion a uniform translation ("uniform" b
ecause ][  ][ it is of constant velocity and direction, " transl
ation " because ][  ][ although the carriage changes its positio
n relative to the embankment ][  ][ yet it does not rotate in so
 doing). Let us imagine a raven flying ][  ][ through the air in
 such a manner that its motion, as observed from the ][  ][ emba
nkment, is uniform and in a straight line. If we were to observe
 ][  ][ the flying raven from the moving railway carriage. we sh
ould find that ][  ][ the motion of the raven would be one of di
fferent velocity and ][  ][ direction, but that it would still b
e uniform and in a straight line. ][  ][ Expressed in an abstrac
t manner we may say : If a mass m is moving ][  ][ uniformly in 
a straight line with respect to a co-ordinate system K, ][  ][ t
hen it will also be moving uniformly and in a straight line rela
tive ][  ][ to a second co-ordinate system K1 provided that the 
latter is ][  ][ executing a uniform translatory motion with res
pect to K. In ][  ][ accordance with the discussion contained in
 the preceding section, it ][  ][ follows that: ][  ][ If K is a
 Galileian co-ordinate system. then every other co-ordinate ][  
][ system K' is a Galileian one, when, in relation to K, it is i
n a ][  ][ condition of uniform motion of translation. Relative 
to K1 the ][  ][ mechanical laws of Galilei-Newton hold good exa
ctly as they do with ][  ][ respect to K. ][  ][ We advance a st
ep farther in our generalisation when we express the ][  ][ tene
t thus: If, relative to K, K1 is a uniformly moving co-ordinate 
][  ][ system devoid of rotation, then natural phenomena run the
ir course ][  ][ with respect to K1 according to exactly the sam
e general laws as with ][  ][ respect to K. This statement is ca
lled the principle of relativity (in ][  ][ the restricted sense
). ][  ][ As long as one was convinced that all natural phenomen
a were capable ][  ][ of representation with the help of classic
al mechanics, there was no ][  ][ need to doubt the validity of 
this principle of relativity. But in ][  ][ view of the more rec
ent development of electrodynamics and optics it ][  ][ became m
ore and more evident that classical mechanics affords an ][  ][ 
insufficient foundation for the physical description of all natu
ral ][  ][ phenomena. At this juncture the question of the valid
ity of the ][  ][ principle of relativity became ripe for discus
sion, and it did not ][  ][ appear impossible that the answer to
 this question might be in the ][  ][ negative. ][  ][ Neverthel
ess, there are two general facts which at the outset speak ][  ]
[ very much in favour of the validity of the principle of relati
vity. ][  ][ Even though classical mechanics does not supply us 
with a sufficiently ][  ][ broad basis for the theoretical prese
ntation of all physical ][  ][ phenomena, still we must grant it
 a considerable measure of " truth," ][  ][ since it supplies us
 with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies ][  ][ with a de
licacy of detail little short of wonderful. The principle of ][ 
 ][ relativity must therefore apply with great accuracy in the d
omain of ][  ][ mechanics. But that a principle of such broad ge
nerality should hold ][  ][ with such exactness in one domain of
 phenomena, and yet should be ][  ][ invalid for another, is a p
riori not very probable. ][  ][ We now proceed to the second arg
ument, to which, moreover, we shall ][  ][ return later. If the 
principle of relativity (in the restricted sense) ][  ][ does no
t hold, then the Galileian co-ordinate systems K, K1, K2, etc., 
][  ][ which are moving uniformly relative to each other, will n
ot be ][  ][ equivalent for the description of natural phenomena
. In this case we ][  ][ should be constrained to believe that n
atural laws are capable of ][  ][ being formulated in a particul
arly simple manner, and of course only ][  ][ on condition that,
 from amongst all possible Galileian co-ordinate ][  ][ systems,
 we should have chosen one (K[0]) of a particular state of ][  ]
[ motion as our body of reference. We should then be justified (
because ][  ][ of its merits for the description of natural phen
omena) in calling ][  ][ this system " absolutely at rest," and 
all other Galileian systems K " ][  ][ in motion." If, for insta
nce, our embankment were the system K[0] then ][  ][ our railway
 carriage would be a system K, relative to which less ][  ][ sim
ple laws would hold than with respect to K[0]. This diminished ]
[  ][ simplicity would be due to the fact that the carriage K wo
uld be in ][  ][ motion (i.e."really")with respect to K[0]. In t
he general laws of ][  ][ nature which have been formulated with
 reference to K, the magnitude ][  ][ and direction of the veloc
ity of the carriage would necessarily play a ][  ][ part. We sho
uld expect, for instance, that the note emitted by an ][  ][ org
anpipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of travel 
][  ][ would be different from that emitted if the axis of the p
ipe were ][  ][ placed perpendicular to this direction. ][  ][ N
ow in virtue of its motion in an orbit round the sun, our earth 
is ][  ][ comparable with a railway carriage travelling with a v
elocity of about ][  ][ 30 kilometres per second. If the princip
le of relativity were not ][  ][ valid we should therefore expec
t that the direction of motion of the ][  ][ earth at any moment
 would enter into the laws of nature, and also that ][  ][ physi
cal systems in their behaviour would be dependent on the ][  ][ 
orientation in space with respect to the earth. For owing to the
 ][  ][ alteration in direction of the velocity of revolution of
 the earth in ][  ][ the course of a year, the earth cannot be a
t rest relative to the ][  ][ hypothetical system K[0] throughou
t the whole year. However, the most ][  ][ careful observations 
have never revealed such anisotropic properties ][  ][ in terres
trial physical space, i.e. a physical non-equivalence of ][  ][ 
different directions. This is very powerful argument in favour o
f the ][  ][ principle of relativity. ][  ][ THE THEOREM OF THE 
][  ][ ADDITION OF VELOCITIES ][  ][ EMPLOYED IN CLASSICAL MECHA
NICS ][  ][ Let us suppose our old friend the railway carriage t
o be travelling ][  ][ along the rails with a constant velocity 
v, and that a man traverses ][  ][ the length of the carriage in
 the direction of travel with a velocity ][  ][ w. How quickly o
r, in other words, with what velocity W does the man ][  ][ adva
nce relative to the embankment during the process ? The only ][ 
 ][ possible answer seems to result from the following considera
tion: If ][  ][ the man were to stand still for a second, he wou
ld advance relative to ][  ][ the embankment through a distance 
v equal numerically to the velocity ][  ][ of the carriage. As a
 consequence of his walking, however, he ][  ][ traverses an add
itional distance w relative to the carriage, and hence ][  ][ al
so relative to the embankment, in this second, the distance w be
ing ][  ][ numerically equal to the velocity with which he is wa
lking. Thus in ][  ][ total be covers the distance W=v+w relativ
e to the embankment in the ][  ][ second considered. We shall se
e later that this result, which ][  ][ expresses the theorem of 
the addition of velocities employed in ][  ][ classical mechanic
s, cannot be maintained ; in other words, the law ][  ][ that we
 have just written down does not hold in reality. For the time ]
[  ][ being, however, we shall assume its correctness. ][  ][ TH

IGHT WITH THE ][  ][ PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ There is har
dly a simpler law in physics than that according to which ][  ][
 light is propagated in empty space. Every child at school knows
, or ][  ][ believes he knows, that this propagation takes place
 in straight lines ][  ][ with a velocity c= 300,000 km./sec. At
 all events we know with great ][  ][ exactness that this veloci
ty is the same for all colours, because if ][  ][ this were not 
the case, the minimum of emission would not be observed ][  ][ s
imultaneously for different colours during the eclipse of a fixe
d ][  ][ star by its dark neighbour. By means of similar conside
rations based ][  ][ on observa- tions of double stars, the Dutc
h astronomer De Sitter was ][  ][ also able to show that the vel
ocity of propagation of light cannot ][  ][ depend on the veloci
ty of motion of the body emitting the light. The ][  ][ assumpti
on that this velocity of propagation is dependent on the ][  ][ 
direction "in space" is in itself improbable. ][  ][ In short, l
et us assume that the simple law of the constancy of the ][  ][ 
velocity of light c (in vacuum) is justifiably believed by the c
hild ][  ][ at school. Who would imagine that this simple law ha
s plunged the ][  ][ conscientiously thoughtful physicist into t
he greatest intellectual ][  ][ difficulties? Let us consider ho
w these difficulties arise. ][  ][ Of course we must refer the p
rocess of the propagation of light (and ][  ][ indeed every othe
r process) to a rigid reference-body (co-ordinate ][  ][ system)
. As such a system let us again choose our embankment. We shall 
][  ][ imagine the air above it to have been removed. If a ray o
f light be ][  ][ sent along the embankment, we see from the abo
ve that the tip of the ][  ][ ray will be transmitted with the v
elocity c relative to the ][  ][ embankment. Now let us suppose 
that our railway carriage is again ][  ][ travelling along the r
ailway lines with the velocity v, and that its ][  ][ direction 
is the same as that of the ray of light, but its velocity of ][ 
 ][ course much less. Let us inquire about the velocity of propa
gation of ][  ][ the ray of light relative to the carriage. It i
s obvious that we can ][  ][ here apply the consideration of the
 previous section, since the ray of ][  ][ light plays the part 
of the man walking along relatively to the ][  ][ carriage. The 
velocity w of the man relative to the embankment is here ][  ][ 
replaced by the velocity of light relative to the embankment. w 
is the ][  ][ required velocity of light with respect to the car
riage, and we have ][  ][                                w = c-v
. ][  ][ The velocity of propagation ot a ray of light relative 
to the carriage ][  ][ thus comes cut smaller than c. ][  ][ But
 this result comes into conflict with the principle of relativit
y ][  ][ set forth in Section V. For, like every other general l
aw of ][  ][ nature, the law of the transmission of light in vac
uo [in vacuum] ][  ][ must, according to the principle of relati
vity, be the same for the ][  ][ railway carriage as reference-b
ody as when the rails are the body of ][  ][ reference. But, fro
m our above consideration, this would appear to be ][  ][ imposs
ible. If every ray of light is propagated relative to the ][  ][
 embankment with the velocity c, then for this reason it would a
ppear ][  ][ that another law of propagation of light must neces
sarily hold with ][  ][ respect to the carriage -- a result cont
radictory to the principle of ][  ][ relativity. ][  ][ In view 
of this dilemma there appears to be nothing else for it than ][ 
 ][ to abandon either the principle of relativity or the simple 
law of the ][  ][ propagation of light in vacuo. Those of you wh
o have carefully ][  ][ followed the preceding discussion are al
most sure to expect that we ][  ][ should retain the principle o
f relativity, which appeals so ][  ][ convincingly to the intell
ect because it is so natural and simple. The ][  ][ law of the p
ropagation of light in vacuo would then have to be ][  ][ replac
ed by a more complicated law conformable to the principle of ][ 
 ][ relativity. The development of theoretical physics shows, ho
wever, ][  ][ that we cannot pursue this course. The epoch-makin
g theoretical ][  ][ investigations of H. A. Lorentz on the elec
trodynamical and optical ][  ][ phenomena connected with moving 
bodies show that experience in this ][  ][ domain leads conclusi
vely to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena, of ][  ][ which t
he law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo is a ]
[  ][ necessary consequence. Prominent theoretical physicists we
re theref ][  ][ ore more inclined to reject the principle of re
lativity, in spite of ][  ][ the fact that no empirical data had
 been found which were ][  ][ contradictory to this principle. ]
[  ][ At this juncture the theory of relativity entered the aren
a. As a ][  ][ result of an analysis of the physical conceptions
 of time and space, ][  ][ it became evident that in realily the
re is not the least ][  ][ incompatibilitiy between the principl
e of relativity and the law of ][  ][ propagation of light, and 
that by systematically holding fast to both ][  ][ these laws a 
logically rigid theory could be arrived at. This theory ][  ][ h
as been called the special theory of relativity to distinguish i
t ][  ][ from the extended theory, with which we shall deal late
r. In the ][  ][ following pages we shall present the fundamenta
l ideas of the special ][  ][ theory of relativity. ][  ][ ON TH
E IDEA OF TIME IN PHYSICS ][  ][ Lightning has struck the rails 
on our railway embankment at two places ][  ][ A and B far dista
nt from each other. I make the additional assertion ][  ][ that 
these two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously. If I ask yo
u ][  ][ whether there is sense in this statement, you will answ
er my question ][  ][ with a decided "Yes." But if I now approac
h you with the request to ][  ][ explain to me the sense of the 
statement more precisely, you find ][  ][ after some considerati
on that the answer to this question is not so ][  ][ easy as it 
appears at first sight. ][  ][ After some time perhaps the follo
wing answer would occur to you: "The ][  ][ significance of the 
statement is clear in itself and needs no further ][  ][ explana
tion; of course it would require some consideration if I were ][
  ][ to be commissioned to determine by observations whether in 
the actual ][  ][ case the two events took place simultaneously 
or not." I cannot be ][  ][ satisfied with this answer for the f
ollowing reason. Supposing that as ][  ][ a result of ingenious 
considerations an able meteorologist were to ][  ][ discover tha
t the lightning must always strike the places A and B ][  ][ sim
ultaneously, then we should be faced with the task of testing ][
  ][ whether or not this theoretical result is in accordance wit
h the ][  ][ reality. We encounter the same difficulty with all 
physical statements ][  ][ in which the conception " simultaneou
s " plays a part. The concept ][  ][ does not exist for the phys
icist until he has the possibility of ][  ][ discovering whether
 or not it is fulfilled in an actual case. We thus ][  ][ requir
e a definition of simultaneity such that this definition ][  ][ 
supplies us with the method by means of which, in the present ca
se, he ][  ][ can decide by experiment whether or not both the l
ightning strokes ][  ][ occurred simultaneously. As long as this
 requirement is not satisfied, ][  ][ I allow myself to be decei
ved as a physicist (and of course the same ][  ][ applies if I a
m not a physicist), when I imagine that I am able to ][  ][ atta
ch a meaning to the statement of simultaneity. (I would ask the 
][  ][ reader not to proceed farther until he is fully convinced
 on this ][  ][ point.) ][  ][ After thinking the matter over fo
r some time you then offer the ][  ][ following suggestion with 
which to test simultaneity. By measuring ][  ][ along the rails,
 the connecting line AB should be measured up and an ][  ][ obse
rver placed at the mid-point M of the distance AB. This observer
 ][  ][ should be supplied with an arrangement (e.g. two mirrors
 inclined at ][  ][ 90^0) which allows him visually to observe b
oth places A and B at the ][  ][ same time. If the observer perc
eives the two flashes of lightning at ][  ][ the same time, then
 they are simultaneous. ][  ][ I am very pleased with this sugge
stion, but for all that I cannot ][  ][ regard the matter as qui
te settled, because I feel constrained to ][  ][ raise the follo
wing objection: ][  ][ "Your definition would certainly be right
, if only I knew that the ][  ][ light by means of which the obs
erver at M perceives the lightning ][  ][ flashes travels along 
the length A arrow M with the same velocity as ][  ][ along the 
length B arrow M. But an examination of this supposition ][  ][ 
would only be possible if we already had at our disposal the mea
ns of ][  ][ measuring time. It would thus appear as though we w
ere moving here in ][  ][ a logical circle." ][  ][ After furthe
r consideration you cast a somewhat disdainful glance at ][  ][ 
me -- and rightly so -- and you declare: ][  ][ "I maintain my p
revious definition nevertheless, because in reality it ][  ][ as
sumes absolutely nothing about light. There is only one demand t
o be ][  ][ made of the definition of simultaneity, namely, that
 in every real ][  ][ case it must supply us with an empirical d
ecision as to whether or not ][  ][ the conception that has to b
e defined is fulfilled. That my definition ][  ][ satisfies this
 demand is indisputable. That light requires the same ][  ][ tim
e to traverse the path A arrow M as for the path B arrow M is in
 ][  ][ reality neither a supposition nor a hypothesis about the
 physical ][  ][ nature of light, but a stipulation which I can 
make of my own freewill ][  ][ in order to arrive at a definitio
n of simultaneity." ][  ][ It is clear that this definition can 
be used to give an exact meaning ][  ][ not only to two events, 
but to as many events as we care to choose, ][  ][ and independe
ntly of the positions of the scenes of the events with ][  ][ re
spect to the body of reference * (here the railway embankment). 
][  ][ We are thus led also to a definition of " time " in physi
cs. For this ][  ][ purpose we suppose that clocks of identical 
construction are placed at ][  ][ the points A, B and C of the r
ailway line (co-ordinate system) and ][  ][ that they are set in
 such a manner that the positions of their ][  ][ pointers are s
imultaneously (in the above sense) the same. Under these ][  ][ 
conditions we understand by the " time " of an event the reading
 ][  ][ (position of the hands) of that one of these clocks whic
h is in the ][  ][ immediate vicinity (in space) of the event. I
n this manner a ][  ][ time-value is associated with every event
 which is essentially capable ][  ][ of observation. ][  ][ This
 stipulation contains a further physical hypothesis, the validit
y ][  ][ of which will hardly be doubted without empirical evide
nce to the ][  ][ contrary. It has been assumed that all these c
locks go at the same ][  ][ rate if they are of identical constr
uction. Stated more exactly: When ][  ][ two clocks arranged at 
rest in different places of a reference-body ][  ][ are set in s
uch a manner that a particular position of the pointers of ][  ]
[ the one clock is simultaneous (in the above sense) with the sa
me ][  ][ position, of the pointers of the other clock, then ide
ntical " ][  ][ settings " are always simultaneous (in the sense
 of the above ][  ][ definition). ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) We su
ppose further, that, when three events A, B and C occur in ][  ]
[ different places in such a manner that A is simultaneous with 
B and B ][  ][ is simultaneous with C (simultaneous in the sense
 of the above ][  ][ definition), then the criterion for the sim
ultaneity of the pair of ][  ][ events A, C is also satisfied. T
his assumption is a physical ][  ][ hypothesis about the the of 
propagation of light: it must certainly be ][  ][ fulfilled if w
e are to maintain the law of the constancy of the ][  ][ velocit
y of light in vacuo. ][  ][ THE RELATIVITY OF SIMULATNEITY ][  ]
[ Up to now our considerations have been referred to a particula
r body ][  ][ of reference, which we have styled a " railway emb
ankment." We suppose ][  ][ a very long train travelling along t
he rails with the constant ][  ][ velocity v and in the directio
n indicated in Fig 1. People travelling ][  ][ in this train wil
l with a vantage view the train as a rigid ][  ][ reference-body
 (co-ordinate system); they regard all events in ][  ][         
               Fig. 01: file fig01.gif ][  ][ reference to the t
rain. Then every event which takes place along the ][  ][ line a
lso takes place at a particular point of the train. Also the ][ 
 ][ definition of simultaneity can be given relative to the trai
n in ][  ][ exactly the same way as with respect to the embankme
nt. As a natural ][  ][ consequence, however, the following ques
tion arises : ][  ][ Are two events (e.g. the two strokes of lig
htning A and B) which are ][  ][ simultaneous with reference to 
the railway embankment also ][  ][ simultaneous relatively to th
e train? We shall show directly that the ][  ][ answer must be i
n the negative. ][  ][ When we say that the lightning strokes A 
and B are simultaneous with ][  ][ respect to be embankment, we 
mean: the rays of light emitted at the ][  ][ places A and B, wh
ere the lightning occurs, meet each other at the ][  ][ mid-poin
t M of the length A arrow B of the embankment. But the events ][
  ][ A and B also correspond to positions A and B on the train. 
Let M1 be ][  ][ the mid-point of the distance A arrow B on the 
travelling train. Just ][  ][ when the flashes (as judged from t
he embankment) of lightning occur, ][  ][ this point M1 naturall
y coincides with the point M but it moves ][  ][ towards the rig
ht in the diagram with the velocity v of the train. If ][  ][ an
 observer sitting in the position M1 in the train did not posses
s ][  ][ this velocity, then he would remain permanently at M, a
nd the light ][  ][ rays emitted by the flashes of lightning A a
nd B would reach him ][  ][ simultaneously, i.e. they would meet
 just where he is situated. Now in ][  ][ reality (considered wi
th reference to the railway embankment) he is ][  ][ hastening t
owards the beam of light coming from B, whilst he is riding ][  
][ on ahead of the beam of light coming from A. Hence the observ
er will ][  ][ see the beam of light emitted from B earlier than
 he will see that ][  ][ emitted from A. Observers who take the 
railway train as their ][  ][ reference-body must therefore come
 to the conclusion that the ][  ][ lightning flash B took place 
earlier than the lightning flash A. We ][  ][ thus arrive at the
 important result: ][  ][ Events which are simultaneous with ref
erence to the embankment are not ][  ][ simultaneous with respec
t to the train, and vice versa (relativity of ][  ][ simultaneit
y). Every reference-body (co-ordinate system) has its own ][  ][
 particular time ; unless we are told the reference-body to whic
h the ][  ][ statement of time refers, there is no meaning in a 
statement of the ][  ][ time of an event. ][  ][ Now before the 
advent of the theory of relativity it had always ][  ][ tacitly 
been assumed in physics that the statement of time had an ][  ][
 absolute significance, i.e. that it is independent of the state
 of ][  ][ motion of the body of reference. But we have just see
n that this ][  ][ assumption is incompatible with the most natu
ral definition of ][  ][ simultaneity; if we discard this assump
tion, then the conflict between ][  ][ the law of the propagatio
n of light in vacuo and the principle of ][  ][ relativity (deve
loped in Section 7) disappears. ][  ][ We were led to that confl
ict by the considerations of Section 6, ][  ][ which are now no 
longer tenable. In that section we concluded that the ][  ][ man
 in the carriage, who traverses the distance w per second relati
ve ][  ][ to the carriage, traverses the same distance also with
 respect to the ][  ][ embankment in each second of time. But, a
ccording to the foregoing ][  ][ considerations, the time requir
ed by a particular occurrence with ][  ][ respect to the carriag
e must not be considered equal to the duration ][  ][ of the sam
e occurrence as judged from the embankment (as ][  ][ reference-
body). Hence it cannot be contended that the man in walking ][  
][ travels the distance w relative to the railway line in a time
 which is ][  ][ equal to one second as judged from the embankme
nt. ][  ][ Moreover, the considerations of Section 6 are based o
n yet a second ][  ][ assumption, which, in the light of a stric
t consideration, appears to ][  ][ be arbitrary, although it was
 always tacitly made even before the ][  ][ introduction of the 
theory of relativity. ][  ][ ON THE RELATIVITY OF THE CONCEPTION
 OF DISTANCE ][  ][ Let us consider two particular points on the
 train * travelling ][  ][ along the embankment with the velocit
y v, and inquire as to their ][  ][ distance apart. We already k
now that it is necessary to have a body of ][  ][ reference for 
the measurement of a distance, with respect to which ][  ][ body
 the distance can be measured up. It is the simplest plan to use
 ][  ][ the train itself as reference-body (co-ordinate system).
 An observer ][  ][ in the train measures the interval by markin
g off his measuring-rod in ][  ][ a straight line (e.g. along th
e floor of the carriage) as many times ][  ][ as is necessary to
 take him from the one marked point to the other. ][  ][ Then th
e number which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down ][
  ][ is the required distance. ][  ][ It is a different matter w
hen the distance has to be judged from the ][  ][ railway line. 
Here the following method suggests itself. If we call ][  ][ A^1
 and B^1 the two points on the train whose distance apart is ][ 
 ][ required, then both of these points are moving with the velo
city v ][  ][ along the embankment. In the first place we requir
e to determine the ][  ][ points A and B of the embankment which
 are just being passed by the ][  ][ two points A^1 and B^1 at a
 particular time t -- judged from the ][  ][ embankment. These p
oints A and B of the embankment can be determined ][  ][ by appl
ying the definition of time given in Section 8. The distance ][ 
 ][ between these points A and B is then measured by repeated ap
plication ][  ][ of thee measuring-rod along the embankment. ][ 
 ][ A priori it is by no means certain that this last measuremen
t will ][  ][ supply us with the same result as the first. Thus 
the length of the ][  ][ train as measured from the embankment m
ay be different from that ][  ][ obtained by measuring in the tr
ain itself. This circumstance leads us ][  ][ to a second object
ion which must be raised against the apparently ][  ][ obvious c
onsideration of Section 6. Namely, if the man in the ][  ][ carr
iage covers the distance w in a unit of time -- measured from th
e ][  ][ train, -- then this distance -- as measured from the em
bankment -- is ][  ][ not necessarily also equal to w. ][  ][   
Notes ][  ][ *) e.g. the middle of the first and of the hundredt
h carriage. ][  ][ THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION ][  ][ The results
 of the last three sections show that the apparent ][  ][ incomp
atibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle 
][  ][ of relativity (Section 7) has been derived by means of a 
][  ][ consideration which borrowed two unjustifiable hypotheses
 from ][  ][ classical mechanics; these are as follows: ][  ][ (
1) The time-interval (time) between two events is independent of
 the ][  ][ condition of motion of the body of reference. ][  ][
 (2) The space-interval (distance) between two points of a rigid
 body ][  ][ is independent of the condition of motion of the bo
dy of reference. ][  ][ If we drop these hypotheses, then the di
lemma of Section 7 ][  ][ disappears, because the theorem of the
 addition of velocities derived ][  ][ in Section 6 becomes inva
lid. The possibility presents itself that ][  ][ the law of the 
propagation of light in vacuo may be compatible with ][  ][ the 
principle of relativity, and the question arises: How have we to
 ][  ][ modify the considerations of Section 6 in order to remov
e the ][  ][ apparent disagreement between these two fundamental
 results of ][  ][ experience? This question leads to a general 
one. In the discussion of ][  ][ Section 6 we have to do with pl
aces and times relative both to the ][  ][ train and to the emba
nkment. How are we to find the place and time of ][  ][ an event
 in relation to the train, when we know the place and time of ][
  ][ the event with respect to the railway embankment ? Is there
 a ][  ][ thinkable answer to this question of such a nature tha
t the law of ][  ][ transmission of light in vacuo does not cont
radict the principle of ][  ][ relativity ? In other words : Can
 we conceive of a relation between ][  ][ place and time of the 
individual events relative to both ][  ][ reference-bodies, such
 that every ray of light possesses the velocity ][  ][ of transm
ission c relative to the embankment and relative to the train ][
  ][ ? This question leads to a quite definite positive answer, 
and to a ][  ][ perfectly definite transformation law for the sp
ace-time magnitudes of ][  ][ an event when changing over from o
ne body of reference to another. ][  ][ Before we deal with this
, we shall introduce the following incidental ][  ][ considerati
on. Up to the present we have only considered events taking ][  
][ place along the embankment, which had mathematically to assum
e the ][  ][ function of a straight line. In the manner indicate
d in Section 2 ][  ][ we can imagine this reference-body supplem
ented laterally and in a ][  ][ vertical direction by means of a
 framework of rods, so that an event ][  ][ which takes place an
ywhere can be localised with reference to this ][  ][ framework.
 Fig. 2 Similarly, we can imagine the train travelling with ][  
][ the velocity v to be continued across the whole of space, so 
that ][  ][ every event, no matter how far off it may be, could 
also be localised ][  ][ with respect to the second framework. W
ithout committing any ][  ][ fundamental error, we can disregard
 the fact that in reality these ][  ][ frameworks would continua
lly interfere with each other, owing to the ][  ][ impenetrabili
ty of solid bodies. In every such framework we imagine ][  ][ th
ree surfaces perpendicular to each other marked out, and designa
ted ][  ][ as " co-ordinate planes " (" co-ordinate system "). A
 co-ordinate ][  ][ system K then corresponds to the embankment,
 and a co-ordinate system ][  ][ K' to the train. An event, wher
ever it may have taken place, would be ][  ][ fixed in space wit
h respect to K by the three perpendiculars x, y, z ][  ][ on the
 co-ordinate planes, and with regard to time by a time value t. 
][  ][ Relative to K1, the same event would be fixed in respect 
of space and ][  ][ time by corresponding values x1, y1, z1, t1,
 which of course are not ][  ][ identical with x, y, z, t. It ha
s already been set forth in detail how ][  ][ these magnitudes a
re to be regarded as results of physical ][  ][ measurements. ][
  ][ Obviously our problem can be exactly formulated in the foll
owing ][  ][ manner. What are the values x1, y1, z1, t1, of an e
vent with respect ][  ][ to K1, when the magnitudes x, y, z, t, 
of the same event with respect ][  ][ to K are given ? The relat
ions must be so chosen that the law of the ][  ][ transmission o
f light in vacuo is satisfied for one and the same ray ][  ][ of
 light (and of course for every ray) with respect to K and K1. F
or ][  ][ the relative orientation in space of the co-ordinate s
ystems indicated ][  ][ in the diagram ([7]Fig. 2), this problem
 is solved by means of the ][  ][ equations : ][  ][            
              eq. 1: file eq01.gif ][  ][                       
          y1 = y ][  ][                                 z1 = z ]
[  ][                          eq. 2: file eq02.gif ][  ][ This 
system of equations is known as the " Lorentz transformation." *
 ][  ][ If in place of the law of transmission of light we had t
aken as our ][  ][ basis the tacit assumptions of the older mech
anics as to the absolute ][  ][ character of times and lengths, 
then instead of the above we should ][  ][ have obtained the fol
lowing equations: ][  ][                              x1 = x - v
t ][  ][                                 y1 = y ][  ][          
                       z1 = z ][  ][                            
     t1 = t ][  ][ This system of equations is often termed the 
" Galilei ][  ][ transformation." The Galilei transformation can
 be obtained from the ][  ][ Lorentz transformation by substitut
ing an infinitely large value for ][  ][ the velocity of light c
 in the latter transformation. ][  ][ Aided by the following ill
ustration, we can readily see that, in ][  ][ accordance with th
e Lorentz transformation, the law of the ][  ][ transmission of 
light in vacuo is satisfied both for the ][  ][ reference-body K
 and for the reference-body K1. A light-signal is sent ][  ][ al
ong the positive x-axis, and this light-stimulus advances in ][ 
 ][ accordance with the equation ][  ][                         
       x = ct, ][  ][ i.e. with the velocity c. According to the
 equations of the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation, this simple rel
ation between x and t involves a ][  ][ relation between x1 and 
t1. In point of fact, if we substitute for x ][  ][ the value ct
 in the first and fourth equations of the Lorentz ][  ][ transfo
rmation, we obtain: ][  ][                          eq. 3: file 
eq03.gif ][  ][                          eq. 4: file eq04.gif ][
  ][ from which, by division, the expression ][  ][             
                   x1 = ct1 ][  ][ immediately follows. If refer
red to the system K1, the propagation of ][  ][ light takes plac
e according to this equation. We thus see that the ][  ][ veloci
ty of transmission relative to the reference-body K1 is also ][ 
 ][ equal to c. The same result is obtained for rays of light ad
vancing in ][  ][ any other direction whatsoever. Of cause this 
is not surprising, since ][  ][ the equations of the Lorentz tra
nsformation were derived conformably ][  ][ to this point of vie
w. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) A simple derivation of the Lorentz t
ransformation is given in ][  ][ Appendix I. ][  ][ THE BEHAVIOU
R OF MEASURING-RODS AND CLOCKS IN MOTION ][  ][ Place a metre-ro
d in the x1-axis of K1 in such a manner that one end ][  ][ (the
 beginning) coincides with the point x1=0 whilst the other end ]
[  ][ (the end of the rod) coincides with the point x1=I. What i
s the length ][  ][ of the metre-rod relatively to the system K?
 In order to learn this, ][  ][ we need only ask where the begin
ning of the rod and the end of the rod ][  ][ lie with respect t
o K at a particular time t of the system K. By means ][  ][ of t
he first equation of the Lorentz transformation the values of ][
  ][ these two points at the time t = 0 can be shown to be ][  ]

               eq. 05b: file eq05b.gif ][  ][ the distance betwe
en the points being eq. 06 . ][  ][ But the metre-rod is moving 
with the velocity v relative to K. It ][  ][ therefore follows t
hat the length of a rigid metre-rod moving in the ][  ][ directi
on of its length with a velocity v is eq. 06 of a metre. ][  ][ 
The rigid rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at rest, 
and ][  ][ the more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod
. For the ][  ][ velocity v=c we should have eq. 06a , ][  ][ an
d for stiII greater velocities the square-root becomes imaginary
. ][  ][ From this we conclude that in the theory of relativity 
the velocity c ][  ][ plays the part of a limiting velocity, whi
ch can neither be reached ][  ][ nor exceeded by any real body. 
][  ][ Of course this feature of the velocity c as a limiting ve
locity also ][  ][ clearly follows from the equations of the Lor
entz transformation, for ][  ][ these became meaningless if we c
hoose values of v greater than c. ][  ][ If, on the contrary, we
 had considered a metre-rod at rest in the ][  ][ x-axis with re
spect to K, then we should have found that the length of ][  ][ 
the rod as judged from K1 would have been eq. 06 ; ][  ][ this i
s quite in accordance with the principle of relativity which ][ 
 ][ forms the basis of our considerations. ][  ][ A Priori it is
 quite clear that we must be able to learn something ][  ][ abou
t the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the ]
[  ][ equations of transformation, for the magnitudes z, y, x, t

nts obtainable by ][  ][ means of measuring-rods and clocks. If 
we had based our considerations ][  ][ on the Galileian transfor
mation we should not have obtained a ][  ][ contraction of the r
od as a consequence of its motion. ][  ][ Let us now consider a 
seconds-clock which is permanently situated at ][  ][ the origin
 (x1=0) of K1. t1=0 and t1=I are two successive ticks of ][  ][ 
this clock. The first and fourth equations of the Lorentz ][  ][
 transformation give for these two ticks : ][  ][               
                  t = 0 ][  ][ and ][  ][                       
  eq. 07: file eq07.gif ][  ][ As judged from K, the clock is mo
ving with the velocity v; as judged ][  ][ from this reference-b
ody, the time which elapses between two strokes ][  ][ of the cl
ock is not one second, but ][  ][                         eq. 08
: file eq08.gif ][  ][ seconds, i.e. a somewhat larger time. As 
a consequence of its motion ][  ][ the clock goes more slowly th
an when at rest. Here also the velocity c ][  ][ plays the part 
of an unattainable limiting velocity. ][  ][ THEOREM OF THE ADDI
TION OF VELOCITIES. ][  ][ THE EXPERIMENT OF FIZEAU ][  ][ Now i
n practice we can move clocks and measuring-rods only with ][  ]
[ velocities that are small compared with the velocity of light;
 hence ][  ][ we shall hardly be able to compare the results of 
the previous section ][  ][ directly with the reality. But, on t
he other hand, these results must ][  ][ strike you as being ver
y singular, and for that reason I shall now ][  ][ draw another 
conclusion from the theory, one which can easily be ][  ][ deriv
ed from the foregoing considerations, and which has been most ][
  ][ elegantly confirmed by experiment. ][  ][ In Section 6 we d
erived the theorem of the addition of velocities ][  ][ in one d
irection in the form which also results from the hypotheses of ]
[  ][ classical mechanics- This theorem can also be deduced read
ily horn the ][  ][ Galilei transformation (Section 11). In plac
e of the man walking ][  ][ inside the carriage, we introduce a 
point moving relatively to the ][  ][ co-ordinate system K1 in a
ccordance with the equation ][  ][                              
  x1 = wt1 ][  ][ By means of the first and fourth equations of 
the Galilei ][  ][ transformation we can express x1 and t1 in te
rms of x and t, and we ][  ][ then obtain ][  ][                
              x = (v + w)t ][  ][ This equation expresses nothin
g else than the law of motion of the ][  ][ point with reference
 to the system K (of the man with reference to the ][  ][ embank
ment). We denote this velocity by the symbol W, and we then ][  
][ obtain, as in Section 6, ][  ][                            W=
v+w         A) ][  ][ But we can carry out this consideration ju
st as well on the basis of ][  ][ the theory of relativity. In t
he equation ][  ][                          x1 = wt1         B) 
][  ][ we must then express x1and t1 in terms of x and t, making
 use of the ][  ][ first and fourth equations of the Lorentz tra
nsformation. Instead of ][  ][ the equation (A) we then obtain t
he equation ][  ][                         eq. 09: file eq09.gif
 ][  ][ which corresponds to the theorem of addition for velocit
ies in one ][  ][ direction according to the theory of relativit
y. The question now ][  ][ arises as to which of these two theor
ems is the better in accord with ][  ][ experience. On this poin
t we axe enlightened by a most important ][  ][ experiment which
 the brilliant physicist Fizeau performed more than ][  ][ half 
a century ago, and which has been repeated since then by some of
 ][  ][ the best experimental physicists, so that there can be n
o doubt about ][  ][ its result. The experiment is concerned wit
h the following question. ][  ][ Light travels in a motionless l
iquid with a particular velocity w. How ][  ][ quickly does it t
ravel in the direction of the arrow in the tube T ][  ][ (see th
e accompanying diagram, Fig. 3) when the liquid above ][  ][ men
tioned is flowing through the tube with a velocity v ? ][  ][ In
 accordance with the principle of relativity we shall certainly 
have ][  ][ to take for granted that the propagation of light al
ways takes place ][  ][ with the same velocity w with respect to
 the liquid, whether the ][  ][ latter is in motion with referen
ce to other bodies or not. The ][  ][ velocity of light relative
 to the liquid and the velocity of the ][  ][ latter relative to
 the tube are thus known, and we require the ][  ][ velocity of 
light relative to the tube. ][  ][ It is clear that we have the 
problem of Section 6 again before us. The ][  ][ tube plays the 
part of the railway embankment or of the co-ordinate ][  ][ syst
em K, the liquid plays the part of the carriage or of the ][  ][
 co-ordinate system K1, and finally, the light plays the part of
 the ][  ][                       Figure 03: file fig03.gif ][  
][ man walking along the carriage, or of the moving point in the
 present ][  ][ section. If we denote the velocity of the light 
relative to the tube ][  ][ by W, then this is given by the equa
tion (A) or (B), according as the ][  ][ Galilei transformation 
or the Lorentz transformation corresponds to ][  ][ the facts. E
xperiment * decides in favour of equation (B) derived ][  ][ fro
m the theory of relativity, and the agreement is, indeed, very ]
[  ][ exact. According to recent and most excellent measurements
 by Zeeman, ][  ][ the influence of the velocity of flow v on th
e propagation of light is ][  ][ represented by formula (B) to w
ithin one per cent. ][  ][ Nevertheless we must now draw attenti
on to the fact that a theory of ][  ][ this phenomenon was given
 by H. A. Lorentz long before the statement ][  ][ of the theory
 of relativity. This theory was of a purely ][  ][ electrodynami
cal nature, and was obtained by the use of particular ][  ][ hyp
otheses as to the electromagnetic structure of matter. This ][  
][ circumstance, however, does not in the least diminish the ][ 
 ][ conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial test in favour
 of the ][  ][ theory of relativity, for the electrodynamics of 
Maxwell-Lorentz, on ][  ][ which the original theory was based, 
in no way opposes the theory of ][  ][ relativity. Rather has th
e latter been developed trom electrodynamics ][  ][ as an astoun
dingly simple combination and generalisation of the ][  ][ hypot
heses, formerly independent of each other, on which ][  ][ elect
rodynamics was built. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) Fizeau found eq. 
10 , where eq. 11 ][  ][ is the index of refraction of the liqui
d. On the other hand, owing to ][  ][ the smallness of eq. 12 as
 compared with I, ][  ][ we can replace (B) in the first place b
y eq. 13 , or to the same order ][  ][ of approximation by ][  ]
[ eq. 14 , which agrees with Fizeau's result. ][  ][ THE HEURIST
IC VALUE OF THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ Our train of thought
 in the foregoing pages can be epitomised in the ][  ][ followin
g manner. Experience has led to the conviction that, on the ][  
][ one hand, the principle of relativity holds true and that on 
the other ][  ][ hand the velocity of transmission of light in v
acuo has to be ][  ][ considered equal to a constant c. By uniti
ng these two postulates we ][  ][ obtained the law of transforma
tion for the rectangular co-ordinates x, ][  ][ y, z and the tim
e t of the events which constitute the processes of ][  ][ natur
e. In this connection we did not obtain the Galilei ][  ][ trans
formation, but, differing from classical mechanics, the Lorentz 
][  ][ transformation. ][  ][ The law of transmission of light, 
the acceptance of which is justified ][  ][ by our actual knowle
dge, played an important part in this process of ][  ][ thought.
 Once in possession of the Lorentz transformation, however, we ]
[  ][ can combine this with the principle of relativity, and sum
 up the ][  ][ theory thus: ][  ][ Every general law of nature m
ust be so constituted that it is ][  ][ transformed into a law o
f exactly the same form when, instead of the ][  ][ space-time v
ariables x, y, z, t of the original coordinate system K, ][  ][ 
we introduce new space-time variables x1, y1, z1, t1 of a co-ord
inate ][  ][ system K1. In this connection the relation between 
the ordinary and ][  ][ the accented magnitudes is given by the 
Lorentz transformation. Or in ][  ][ brief : General laws of nat
ure are co-variant with respect to Lorentz ][  ][ transformation
s. ][  ][ This is a definite mathematical condition that the the
ory of ][  ][ relativity demands of a natural law, and in virtue
 of this, the theory ][  ][ becomes a valuable heuristic aid in 
the search for general laws of ][  ][ nature. If a general law o
f nature were to be found which did not ][  ][ satisfy this cond
ition, then at least one of the two fundamental ][  ][ assumptio
ns of the theory would have been disproved. Let us now ][  ][ ex
amine what general results the latter theory has hitherto evince
d. ][  ][ GENERAL RESULTS OF THE THEORY ][  ][ It is clear from 
our previous considerations that the (special) theory ][  ][ of 
relativity has grown out of electrodynamics and optics. In these
 ][  ][ fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions of
 theory, but ][  ][ it has considerably simplified the theoretic
al structure, i.e. the ][  ][ derivation of laws, and -- what is
 incomparably more important -- it ][  ][ has considerably reduc
ed the number of independent hypothese forming ][  ][ the basis 
of theory. The special theory of relativity has rendered the ][ 
 ][ Maxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the latter would h
ave been ][  ][ generally accepted by physicists even if experim
ent had decided less ][  ][ unequivocally in its favour. ][  ][ 
Classical mechanics required to be modified before it could come
 into ][  ][ line with the demands of the special theory of rela
tivity. For the ][  ][ main part, however, this modification aff
ects only the laws for rapid ][  ][ motions, in which the veloci
ties of matter v are not very small as ][  ][ compared with the 
velocity of light. We have experience of such rapid ][  ][ motio
ns only in the case of electrons and ions; for other motions the
 ][  ][ variations from the laws of classical mechanics are too 
small to make ][  ][ themselves evident in practice. We shall no
t consider the motion of ][  ][ stars until we come to speak of 
the general theory of relativity. In ][  ][ accordance with the 
theory of relativity the kinetic energy of a ][  ][ material poi
nt of mass m is no longer given by the well-known ][  ][ express
ion ][  ][                         eq. 15: file eq15.gif ][  ][ 
but by the expression ][  ][                         eq. 16: fil
e eq16.gif ][  ][ This expression approaches infinity as the vel
ocity v approaches the ][  ][ velocity of light c. The velocity 
must therefore always remain less ][  ][ than c, however great m
ay be the energies used to produce the ][  ][ acceleration. If w
e develop the expression for the kinetic energy in ][  ][ the fo
rm of a series, we obtain ][  ][                         eq. 17:
 file eq17.gif ][  ][ When eq. 18 is small compared with unity, 
the third of these terms is ][  ][ always small in comparison wi
th the second, ][  ][ which last is alone considered in classica
l mechanics. The first term ][  ][ mc^2 does not contain the vel
ocity, and requires no consideration if ][  ][ we are only deali
ng with the question as to how the energy of a ][  ][ point-mass
; depends on the velocity. We shall speak of its essential ][  ]
[ significance later. ][  ][ The most important result of a gene
ral character to which the special ][  ][ theory of relativity h
as led is concerned with the conception of mass. ][  ][ Before t
he advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation ][ 
 ][ laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the canse
rvation of ][  ][ energy and the law of the conservation of mass
 these two fundamental ][  ][ laws appeared to be quite independ
ent of each other. By means of the ][  ][ theory of relativity t
hey have been united into one law. We shall now ][  ][ briefly c
onsider how this unification came about, and what meaning is ][ 
 ][ to be attached to it. ][  ][ The principle of relativity req
uires that the law of the concervation ][  ][ of energy should h
old not only with reference to a co-ordinate system ][  ][ K, bu
t also with respect to every co-ordinate system K1 which is in a
 ][  ][ state of uniform motion of translation relative to K, or
, briefly, ][  ][ relative to every " Galileian " system of co-o
rdinates. In contrast to ][  ][ classical mechanics; the Lorentz
 transformation is the deciding factor ][  ][ in the transition 
from one such system to another. ][  ][ By means of comparativel
y simple considerations we are led to draw the ][  ][ following 
conclusion from these premises, in conjunction with the ][  ][ f
undamental equations of the electrodynamics of Maxwell: A body m
oving ][  ][ with the velocity v, which absorbs * an amount of e
nergy E[0] in ][  ][ the form of radiation without suffering an 
alteration in velocity in ][  ][ the process, has, as a conseque
nce, its energy increased by an amount ][  ][                   
      eq. 19: file eq19.gif ][  ][ In consideration of the expre
ssion given above for the kinetic energy ][  ][ of the body, the
 required energy of the body comes out to be ][  ][             
            eq. 20: file eq20.gif ][  ][ Thus the body has the s
ame energy as a body of mass ][  ][                          eq.
21: file eq21.gif ][  ][ moving with the velocity v. Hence we ca
n say: If a body takes up an ][  ][ amount of energy E[0], then 
its inertial mass increases by an amount ][  ][                 
        eq. 22: file eq22.gif ][  ][ the inertial mass of a body
 is not a constant but varies according to ][  ][ the change in 
the energy of the body. The inertial mass of a system of ][  ][ 
bodies can even be regarded as a measure of its energy. The law 
of the ][  ][ conservation of the mass of a system becomes ident
ical with the law of ][  ][ the conservation of energy, and is o
nly valid provided that the system ][  ][ neither takes up nor s
ends out energy. Writing the expression for the ][  ][ energy in
 the form ][  ][                         eq. 23: file eq23.gif ]
[  ][ we see that the term mc^2, which has hitherto attracted ou
r attention, ][  ][ is nothing else than the energy possessed by
 the body ** before it ][  ][ absorbed the energy E[0]. ][  ][ A
 direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not possi
ble ][  ][ at the present time (1920; see *** Note, p. 48), owin
g to the fact that ][  ][ the changes in energy E[0] to which we
 can Subject a system are not ][  ][ large enough to make themse
lves perceptible as a change in the ][  ][ inertial mass of the 
system. ][  ][                                 eq. 22: file eq22
.gif ][  ][ is too small in comparison with the mass m, which wa
s present before ][  ][ the alteration of the energy. It is owin
g to this circumstance that ][  ][ classical mechanics was able 
to establish successfully the ][  ][ conservation of mass as a l
aw of independent validity. ][  ][ Let me add a final remark of 
a fundamental nature. The success of the ][  ][ Faraday-Maxwell 
interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance ][  ][ re
sulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such ]
[  ][ things as instantaneous actions at a distance (not involvi
ng an ][  ][ intermediary medium) of the type of Newton's law of
 gravitation. ][  ][ According to the theory of relativity, acti
on at a distance with the ][  ][ velocity of light always takes 
the place of instantaneous action at a ][  ][ distance or of act
ion at a distance with an infinite velocity of ][  ][ transmissi
on. This is connected with the fact that the velocity c ][  ][ p
lays a fundamental role in this theory. In Part II we shall see 
in ][  ][ what way this result becomes modified in the general t
heory of ][  ][ relativity. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) E[0] is the
 energy taken up, as judged from a co-ordinate system ][  ][ mov
ing with the body. ][  ][ **) As judged from a co-ordinate syste
m moving with the body. ][  ][ ***[Note] The equation E = mc^2 h
as been thoroughly proved time and ][  ][ again since this time.
 ][  ][ EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ T
o what extent is the special theory of relativity supported by ]
[  ][ experience?  This question is not easily answered for the 
reason ][  ][ already mentioned in connection with the fundament
al experiment of ][  ][ Fizeau. The special theory of relativity
 has crystallised out from the ][  ][ Maxwell-Lorentz theory of 
electromagnetic phenomena. Thus all facts of ][  ][ experience w
hich support the electromagnetic theory also support the ][  ][ 
theory of relativity. As being of particular importance, I menti
on ][  ][ here the fact that the theory of relativity enables us
 to predict the ][  ][ effects produced on the light reaching us
 from the fixed stars. These ][  ][ results are obtained in an e
xceedingly simple manner, and the effects ][  ][ indicated, whic
h are due to the relative motion of the earth with ][  ][ refere
nce to those fixed stars are found to be in accord with ][  ][ e
xperience. We refer to the yearly movement of the apparent posit
ion ][  ][ of the fixed stars resulting from the motion of the e
arth round the ][  ][ sun (aberration), and to the influence of 
the radial components of the ][  ][ relative motions of the fixe
d stars with respect to the earth on the ][  ][ colour of the li
ght reaching us from them. The latter effect manifests ][  ][ it
self in a slight displacement of the spectral lines of the light
 ][  ][ transmitted to us from a fixed star, as compared with th
e position of ][  ][ the same spectral lines when they are produ
ced by a terrestrial source ][  ][ of light (Doppler principle).
 The experimental arguments in favour of ][  ][ the Maxwell-Lore
ntz theory, which are at the same time arguments in ][  ][ favou
r of the theory of relativity, are too numerous to be set forth 
][  ][ here. In reality they limit the theoretical possibilities
 to such an ][  ][ extent, that no other theory than that of Max
well and Lorentz has been ][  ][ able to hold its own when teste
d by experience. ][  ][ But there are two classes of experimenta
l facts hitherto obtained ][  ][ which can be represented in the
 Maxwell-Lorentz theory only by the ][  ][ introduction of an au
xiliary hypothesis, which in itself -- i.e. ][  ][ without makin
g use of the theory of relativity -- appears extraneous. ][  ][ 
It is known that cathode rays and the so-called b-rays emitted b
y ][  ][ radioactive substances consist of negatively electrifie
d particles ][  ][ (electrons) of very small inertia and large v
elocity. By examining the ][  ][ deflection of these rays under 
the influence of electric and magnetic ][  ][ fields, we can stu
dy the law of motion of these particles very ][  ][ exactly. ][ 
 ][ In the theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are face
d with the ][  ][ difficulty that electrodynamic theory of itsel
f is unable to give an ][  ][ account of their nature. For since
 electrical masses of one sign repel ][  ][ each other, the nega
tive electrical masses constituting the electron ][  ][ would ne
cessarily be scattered under the influence of their mutual ][  ]
[ repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating 
between ][  ][ them, the nature of which has hitherto remained o
bscure to us.*   If ][  ][ we now assume that the relative dista
nces between the electrical ][  ][ masses constituting the elect
ron remain unchanged during the motion of ][  ][ the electron (r
igid connection in the sense of classical mechanics), ][  ][ we 
arrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not agree w
ith ][  ][ experience. Guided by purely formal points of view, H
. A. Lorentz was ][  ][ the first to introduce the hypothesis th
at the form of the electron ][  ][ experiences a contraction in 
the direction of motion in consequence of ][  ][ that motion. th
e contracted length being proportional to the ][  ][ expression 
][  ][                         eq. 05: file eq05.gif ][  ][ This
, hypothesis, which is not justifiable by any electrodynamical ]
[  ][ facts, supplies us then with that particular law of motion
 which has ][  ][ been confirmed with great precision in recent 
years. ][  ][ The theory of relativity leads to the same law of 
motion, without ][  ][ requiring any special hypothesis whatsoev
er as to the structure and ][  ][ the behaviour of the electron.
 We arrived at a similar conclusion in ][  ][ Section 13 in conn
ection with the experiment of Fizeau, the result ][  ][ of which
 is foretold by the theory of relativity without the necessity ]
[  ][ of drawing on hypotheses as to the physical nature of the 
liquid. ][  ][ The second class of facts to which we have allude
d has reference to ][  ][ the question whether or not the motion
 of the earth in space can be ][  ][ made perceptible in terrest
rial experiments. We have already remarked ][  ][ in Section 5 t
hat all attempts of this nature led to a negative ][  ][ result.
 Before the theory of relativity was put forward, it was ][  ][ 
difficult to become reconciled to this negative result, for reas
ons ][  ][ now to be discussed. The inherited prejudices about t
ime and space did ][  ][ not allow any doubt to arise as to the 
prime importance of the ][  ][ Galileian transformation for chan
ging over from one body of reference ][  ][ to another. Now assu
ming that the Maxwell-Lorentz equations hold for a ][  ][ refere
nce-body K, we then find that they do not hold for a ][  ][ refe
rence-body K1 moving uniformly with respect to K, if we assume ]
[  ][ that the relations of the Galileian transformstion exist b
etween the ][  ][ co-ordinates of K and K1. It thus appears that
, of all Galileian ][  ][ co-ordinate systems, one (K) correspon
ding to a particular state of ][  ][ motion is physically unique
. This result was interpreted physically by ][  ][ regarding K a
s at rest with respect to a hypothetical ?ther of space. ][  ][ 
On the other hand, all coordinate systems K1 moving relatively t
o K ][  ][ were to be regarded as in motion with respect to the 
?ther. To this ][  ][ motion of K1 against the ?ther ("?ther-dri
ft " relative to K1) were ][  ][ attributed the more complicated
 laws which were supposed to hold ][  ][ relative to K1. Strictl
y speaking, such an ?ther-drift ought also to ][  ][ be assumed 
relative to the earth, and for a long time the efforts of ][  ][
 physicists were devoted to attempts to detect the existence of 
an ][  ][ ?ther-drift at the earth's surface. ][  ][ In one of t
he most notable of these attempts Michelson devised a ][  ][ met
hod which appears as though it must be decisive. Imagine two ][ 
 ][ mirrors so arranged on a rigid body that the reflecting surf
aces face ][  ][ each other. A ray of light requires a perfectly
 definite time T to ][  ][ pass from one mirror to the other and
 back again, if the whole system ][  ][ be at rest with respect 
to the ?ther. It is found by calculation, ][  ][ however, that a
 slightly different time T1 is required for this ][  ][ process,
 if the body, together with the mirrors, be moving relatively ][
  ][ to the ?ther. And yet another point: it is shown by calcula
tion that ][  ][ for a given velocity v with reference to the ?t
her, this time T1 is ][  ][ different when the body is moving pe
rpendicularly to the planes of the ][  ][ mirrors from that resu
lting when the motion is parallel to these ][  ][ planes. Althou
gh the estimated difference between these two times is ][  ][ ex
ceedingly small, Michelson and Morley performed an experiment ][
  ][ involving interference in which this difference should have
 been ][  ][ clearly detectable. But the experiment gave a negat
ive result -- a ][  ][ fact very perplexing to physicists. Loren
tz and FitzGerald rescued the ][  ][ theory from this difficulty
 by assuming that the motion of the body ][  ][ relative to the 
?ther produces a contraction of the body in the ][  ][ direction
 of motion, the amount of contraction being just sufficient ][  
][ to compensate for the differeace in time mentioned above. Com
parison ][  ][ with the discussion in Section 11 shows that also
 from the ][  ][ standpoint of the theory of relativity this sol
ution of the difficulty ][  ][ was the right one. But on the bas
is of the theory of relativity the ][  ][ method of interpretati
on is incomparably more satisfactory. According ][  ][ to this t
heory there is no such thing as a " specially favoured " ][  ][ 
(unique) co-ordinate system to occasion the introduction of the 
][  ][ ?ther-idea, and hence there can be no ?ther-drift, nor an
y experiment ][  ][ with which to demonstrate it. Here the contr
action of moving bodies ][  ][ follows from the two fundamental 
principles of the theory, without the ][  ][ introduction of par
ticular hypotheses ; and as the prime factor ][  ][ involved in 
this contraction we find, not the motion in itself, to ][  ][ wh
ich we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with respect to
 the ][  ][ body of reference chosen in the particular case in p
oint. Thus for a ][  ][ co-ordinate system moving with the earth
 the mirror system of ][  ][ Michelson and Morley is not shorten
ed, but it is shortened for a ][  ][ co-ordinate system which is
 at rest relatively to the sun. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) The gen
eral theory of relativity renders it likely that the ][  ][ elec
trical masses of an electron are held together by gravitational 
][  ][ forces. ][  ][ MINKOWSKI'S FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACE ][  ][ 
The non-mathematician is seized by a mysterious shuddering when 
he ][  ][ hears of "four-dimensional" things, by a feeling not u
nlike that ][  ][ awakened by thoughts of the occult. And yet th
ere is no more ][  ][ common-place statement than that the world
 in which we live is a ][  ][ four-dimensional space-time contin
uum. ][  ][ Space is a three-dimensional continuum. By this we m
ean that it is ][  ][ possible to describe the position of a poi
nt (at rest) by means of ][  ][ three numbers (co-ordinales) x, 
y, z, and that there is an indefinite ][  ][ number of points in
 the neighbourhood of this one, the position of ][  ][ which can
 be described by co-ordinates such as x[1], y[1], z[1], which ][
  ][ may be as near as we choose to the respective values of the
 ][  ][ co-ordinates x, y, z, of the first point. In virtue of t
he latter ][  ][ property we speak of a " continuum," and owing 
to the fact that there ][  ][ are three co-ordinates we speak of
 it as being " three-dimensional." ][  ][ Similarly, the world o
f physical phenomena which was briefly called " ][  ][ world " b
y Minkowski is naturally four dimensional in the space-time ][  
][ sense. For it is composed of individual events, each of which
 is ][  ][ described by four numbers, namely, three space co-ord
inates x, y, z, ][  ][ and a time co-ordinate, the time value t.
 The" world" is in this sense ][  ][ also a continuum; for to ev
ery event there are as many "neighbouring" ][  ][ events (realis
ed or at least thinkable) as we care to choose, the ][  ][ co-or
dinates x[1], y[1], z[1], t[1] of which differ by an indefinitel
y ][  ][ small amount from those of the event x, y, z, t origina
lly considered. ][  ][ That we have not been accustomed to regar
d the world in this sense as ][  ][ a four-dimensional continuum
 is due to the fact that in physics, ][  ][ before the advent of
 the theory of relativity, time played a different ][  ][ and mo
re independent role, as compared with the space coordinates. It 
][  ][ is for this reason that we have been in the habit of trea
ting time as ][  ][ an independent continuum. As a matter of fac
t, according to classical ][  ][ mechanics, time is absolute, i.
e. it is independent of the position ][  ][ and the condition of
 motion of the system of co-ordinates. We see this ][  ][ expres
sed in the last equation of the Galileian transformation (t1 = ]
[  ][ t) ][  ][ The four-dimensional mode of consideration of th
e "world" is natural ][  ][ on the theory of relativity, since a
ccording to this theory time is ][  ][ robbed of its independenc
e. This is shown by the fourth equation of ][  ][ the Lorentz tr
ansformation: ][  ][                         eq. 24: file eq24.g
if ][  ][ Moreover, according to this equation the time differen
ce Dt1 of two ][  ][ events with respect to K1 does not in gener
al vanish, even when the ][  ][ time difference Dt1 of the same 
events with reference to K vanishes. ][  ][ Pure " space-distanc
e " of two events with respect to K results in " ][  ][ time-dis
tance " of the same events with respect to K. But the ][  ][ dis
covery of Minkowski, which was of importance for the formal ][  
][ development of the theory of relativity, does not lie here. I
t is to ][  ][ be found rather in the fact of his recognition th
at the ][  ][ four-dimensional space-time continuum of the theor
y of relativity, in ][  ][ its most essential formal properties,
 shows a pronounced relationship ][  ][ to the three-dimensional
 continuum of Euclidean geometrical ][  ][ space.*  In order to 
give due prominence to this relationship, ][  ][ however, we mus
t replace the usual time co-ordinate t by an imaginary ][  ][ ma
gnitude eq. 25 proportional to it. Under these conditions, the ]
[  ][ natural laws satisfying the demands of the (special) theor
y of ][  ][ relativity assume mathematical forms, in which the t
ime co-ordinate ][  ][ plays exactly the same role as the three 
space co-ordinates. Formally, ][  ][ these four co-ordinates cor
respond exactly to the three space ][  ][ co-ordinates in Euclid
ean geometry. It must be clear even to the ][  ][ non-mathematic
ian that, as a consequence of this purely formal ][  ][ addition
 to our knowledge, the theory perforce gained clearness in no ][
  ][ mean measure. ][  ][ These inadequate remarks can give the 
reader only a vague notion of ][  ][ the important idea contribu
ted by Minkowski. Without it the general ][  ][ theory of relati
vity, of which the fundamental ideas are developed in ][  ][ the
 following pages, would perhaps have got no farther than its lon
g ][  ][ clothes. Minkowski's work is doubtless difficult of acc
ess to anyone ][  ][ inexperienced in mathematics, but since it 
is not necessary to have a ][  ][ very exact grasp of this work 
in order to understand the fundamental ][  ][ ideas of either th
e special or the general theory of relativity, I ][  ][ shall le
ave it here at present, and revert to it only towards the end ][
  ][ of Part 2. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) Cf. the somewhat more d
etailed discussion in Appendix II. ][  ][ PART II ][  ][ THE GEN
ERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ SPECIAL AND GENERAL PRINCIPLE O
F RELATIVITY ][  ][ The basal principle, which was the pivot of 
all our previous ][  ][ considerations, was the special principl
e of relativity, i.e. the ][  ][ principle of the physical relat
ivity of all uniform motion. Let as ][  ][ once more analyse its
 meaning carefully. ][  ][ It was at all times clear that, from 
the point of view of the idea it ][  ][ conveys to us, every mot
ion must be considered only as a relative ][  ][ motion. Returni
ng to the illustration we have frequently used of the ][  ][ emb
ankment and the railway carriage, we can express the fact of the
 ][  ][ motion here taking place in the following two forms, bot
h of which are ][  ][ equally justifiable : ][  ][ (a) The carri
age is in motion relative to the embankment, ][  ][ (b) The emba
nkment is in motion relative to the carriage. ][  ][ In (a) the 
embankment, in (b) the carriage, serves as the body of ][  ][ re
ference in our statement of the motion taking place. If it is si
mply ][  ][ a question of detecting or of describing the motion 
involved, it is in ][  ][ principle immaterial to what reference
-body we refer the motion. As ][  ][ already mentioned, this is 
self-evident, but it must not be confused ][  ][ with the much m
ore comprehensive statement called "the principle of ][  ][ rela
tivity," which we have taken as the basis of our investigations.
 ][  ][ The principle we have made use of not only maintains tha
t we may ][  ][ equally well choose the carriage or the embankme
nt as our ][  ][ reference-body for the description of any event
 (for this, too, is ][  ][ self-evident). Our principle rather a
sserts what follows : If we ][  ][ formulate the general laws of
 nature as they are obtained from ][  ][ experience, by making u
se of ][  ][ (a) the embankment as reference-body, ][  ][ (b) th
e railway carriage as reference-body, ][  ][ then these general 
laws of nature (e.g. the laws of mechanics or the ][  ][ law of 
the propagation of light in vacuo) have exactly the same form ][
  ][ in both cases. This can also be expressed as follows : For 
the ][  ][ physical description of natural processes, neither of
 the reference ][  ][ bodies K, K1 is unique (lit. " specially m
arked out ") as compared ][  ][ with the other. Unlike the first
, this latter statement need not of ][  ][ necessity hold a prio
ri; it is not contained in the conceptions of " ][  ][ motion" a
nd " reference-body " and derivable from them; only ][  ][ exper
ience can decide as to its correctness or incorrectness. ][  ][ 
Up to the present, however, we have by no means maintained the ]
[  ][ equivalence of all bodies of reference K in connection wit
h the ][  ][ formulation of natural laws. Our course was more on
 the following ][  ][ Iines. In the first place, we started out 
from the assumption that ][  ][ there exists a reference-body K,
 whose condition of motion is such ][  ][ that the Galileian law
 holds with respect to it : A particle left to ][  ][ itself and
 sufficiently far removed from all other particles moves ][  ][ 
uniformly in a straight line. With reference to K (Galileian ][ 
 ][ reference-body) the laws of nature were to be as simple as p
ossible. ][  ][ But in addition to K, all bodies of reference K1
 should be given ][  ][ preference in this sense, and they shoul
d be exactly equivalent to K ][  ][ for the formulation of natur
al laws, provided that they are in a state ][  ][ of uniform rec
tilinear and non-rotary motion with respect to K ; all ][  ][ th
ese bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian ][  ][ r
eference-bodies. The validity of the principle of relativity was
 ][  ][ assumed only for these reference-bodies, but not for oth
ers (e.g. ][  ][ those possessing motion of a different kind). I
n this sense we speak ][  ][ of the special principle of relativ
ity, or special theory of ][  ][ relativity. ][  ][ In contrast 
to this we wish to understand by the "general principle of ][  ]
[ relativity" the following statement : All bodies of reference 
K, K1, ][  ][ etc., are equivalent for the description of natura
l phenomena ][  ][ (formulation of the general laws of nature), 
whatever may be their ][  ][ state of motion. But before proceed
ing farther, it ought to be pointed ][  ][ out that this formula
tion must be replaced later by a more abstract ][  ][ one, for r
easons which will become evident at a later stage. ][  ][ Since 
the introduction of the special principle of relativity has been
 ][  ][ justified, every intellect which strives after generalis
ation must ][  ][ feel the temptation to venture the step toward
s the general principle ][  ][ of relativity. But a simple and a
pparently quite reliable ][  ][ consideration seems to suggest t
hat, for the present at any rate, ][  ][ there is little hope of
 success in such an attempt; Let us imagine ][  ][ ourselves tra
nsferred to our old friend the railway carriage, which is ][  ][
 travelling at a uniform rate. As long as it is moving unifromly
, the ][  ][ occupant of the carriage is not sensible of its mot
ion, and it is for ][  ][ this reason that he can without reluct
ance interpret the facts of the ][  ][ case as indicating that t
he carriage is at rest, but the embankment in ][  ][ motion. Mor
eover, according to the special principle of relativity, ][  ][ 
this interpretation is quite justified also from a physical poin
t of ][  ][ view. ][  ][ If the motion of the carriage is now ch
anged into a non-uniform ][  ][ motion, as for instance by a pow
erful application of the brakes, then ][  ][ the occupant of the
 carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful ][  ][ jerk for
wards. The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical ][  ]
[ behaviour of bodies relative to the person in the railway carr
iage. ][  ][ The mechanical behaviour is different from that of 
the case previously ][  ][ considered, and for this reason it wo
uld appear to be impossible that ][  ][ the same mechanical laws
 hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving ][  ][ carriage, as
 hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in ][  ][ u
niform motion. At all events it is clear that the Galileian law 
does ][  ][ not hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving ca
rriage. Because of ][  ][ this, we feel compelled at the present
 juncture to grant a kind of ][  ][ absolute physical reality to
 non-uniform motion, in opposition to the ][  ][ general princip
le of relatvity. But in what follows we shall soon see ][  ][ th
at this conclusion cannot be maintained. ][  ][ THE GRAVITATIONA
L FIELD ][  ][ "If we pick up a stone and then let it go, why do
es it fall to the ][  ][ ground ?" The usual answer to this ques
tion is: "Because it is ][  ][ attracted by the earth." Modern p
hysics formulates the answer rather ][  ][ differently for the f
ollowing reason. As a result of the more careful ][  ][ study of
 electromagnetic phenomena, we have come to regard action at a ]
[  ][ distance as a process impossible without the intervention 
of some ][  ][ intermediary medium. If, for instance, a magnet a
ttracts a piece of ][  ][ iron, we cannot be content to regard t
his as meaning that the magnet ][  ][ acts directly on the iron 
through the intermediate empty space, but we ][  ][ are constrai
ned to imagine -- after the manner of Faraday -- that the ][  ][
 magnet always calls into being something physically real in the
 space ][  ][ around it, that something being what we call a "ma
gnetic field." In ][  ][ its turn this magnetic field operates o
n the piece of iron, so that ][  ][ the latter strives to move t
owards the magnet. We shall not discuss ][  ][ here the justific
ation for this incidental conception, which is indeed ][  ][ a s
omewhat arbitrary one. We shall only mention that with its aid ]
[  ][ electromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically represented
 much more ][  ][ satisfactorily than without it, and this appli
es particularly to the ][  ][ transmission of electromagnetic wa
ves. The effects of gravitation also ][  ][ are regarded in an a
nalogous manner. ][  ][ The action of the earth on the stone tak
es place indirectly. The earth ][  ][ produces in its surroundin
g a gravitational field, which acts on the ][  ][ stone and prod
uces its motion of fall. As we know from experience, the ][  ][ 
intensity of the action on a body dimishes according to a quite 
][  ][ definite law, as we proceed farther and farther away from
 the earth. ][  ][ From our point of view this means : The law g
overning the properties ][  ][ of the gravitational field in spa
ce must be a perfectly definite one, ][  ][ in order correctly t
o represent the diminution of gravitational action ][  ][ with t
he distance from operative bodies. It is something like this: ][
  ][ The body (e.g. the earth) produces a field in its immediate
 ][  ][ neighbourhood directly; the intensity and direction of t
he field at ][  ][ points farther removed from the body are then
ce determined by the law ][  ][ which governs the properties in 
space of the gravitational fields ][  ][ themselves. ][  ][ In c
ontrast to electric and magnetic fields, the gravitational field
 ][  ][ exhibits a most remarkable property, which is of fundame
ntal ][  ][ importance for what follows. Bodies which are moving
 under the sole ][  ][ influence of a gravitational field receiv
e an acceleration, which does ][  ][ not in the least depend eit
her on the material or on the physical ][  ][ state of the body.
 For instance, a piece of lead and a piece of wood ][  ][ fall i
n exactly the same manner in a gravitational field (in vacuo), ]
[  ][ when they start off from rest or with the same initial vel
ocity. This ][  ][ law, which holds most accurately, can be expr
essed in a different form ][  ][ in the light of the following c
onsideration. ][  ][ According to Newton's law of motion, we hav
e ][  ][ (Force) = (inertial mass) x (acceleration), ][  ][ wher
e the "inertial mass" is a characteristic constant of the ][  ][
 accelerated body. If now gravitation is the cause of the accele
ration, ][  ][ we then have ][  ][ (Force) = (gravitational mass
) x (intensity of the gravitational ][  ][ field), ][  ][ where 
the "gravitational mass" is likewise a characteristic constant ]
[  ][ for the body. From these two relations follows: ][  ][    
                             eq. 26: file eq26.gif ][  ][ If now
, as we find from experience, the acceleration is to be ][  ][ i
ndependent of the nature and the condition of the body and alway
s the ][  ][ same for a given gravitational field, then the rati
o of the ][  ][ gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise
 be the same for all ][  ][ bodies. By a suitable choice of unit
s we can thus make this ratio ][  ][ equal to unity. We then hav
e the following law: The gravitational mass ][  ][ of a body is 
equal to its inertial law. ][  ][ It is true that this important
 law had hitherto been recorded in ][  ][ mechanics, but it had 
not been interpreted. A satisfactory ][  ][ interpretation can b
e obtained only if we recognise the following fact ][  ][ : The 
same quality of a body manifests itself according to ][  ][ circ
umstances as " inertia " or as " weight " (lit. " heaviness '). 
In ][  ][ the following section we shall show to what extent thi
s is actually ][  ][ the case, and how this question is connecte
d with the general ][  ][ postulate of relativity. ][  ][ THE EQ
UALITY OF INERTIAL AND GRAVITATIONAL MASS ][  ][ AS AN ARGUMENT 
FOR THE GENERAL POSTULE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ We imagine a large 
portion of empty space, so far removed from stars ][  ][ and oth
er appreciable masses, that we have before us approximately the 
][  ][ conditions required by the fundamental law of Galilei. It
 is then ][  ][ possible to choose a Galileian reference-body fo
r this part of space ][  ][ (world), relative to which points at
 rest remain at rest and points in ][  ][ motion continue perman
ently in uniform rectilinear motion. As ][  ][ reference-body le
t us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with ][  ][ an o
bserver inside who is equipped with apparatus. Gravitation ][  ]
[ naturally does not exist for this observer. He must fasten him
self ][  ][ with strings to the floor, otherwise the slightest i
mpact against the ][  ][ floor will cause him to rise slowly tow
ards the ceiling of the room. ][  ][ To the middle of the lid of
 the chest is fixed externally a hook with ][  ][ rope attached,
 and now a " being " (what kind of a being is immaterial ][  ][ 
to us) begins pulling at this with a constant force. The chest ]
[  ][ together with the observer then begin to move "upwards" wi
th a ][  ][ uniformly accelerated motion. In course of time thei
r velocity will ][  ][ reach unheard-of values -- provided that 
we are viewing all this from ][  ][ another reference-body which
 is not being pulled with a rope. ][  ][ But how does the man in
 the chest regard the Process ? The ][  ][ acceleration of the c
hest will be transmitted to him by the reaction ][  ][ of the fl
oor of the chest. He must therefore take up this pressure by ][ 
 ][ means of his legs if he does not wish to be laid out full le
ngth on ][  ][ the floor. He is then standing in the chest in ex
actly the same way as ][  ][ anyone stands in a room of a home o
n our earth. If he releases a body ][  ][ which he previously ha
d in his land, the accelertion of the chest will ][  ][ no longe
r be transmitted to this body, and for this reason the body ][  
][ will approach the floor of the chest with an accelerated rela
tive ][  ][ motion. The observer will further convince himself t
hat the ][  ][ acceleration of the body towards the floor of the
 chest is always of ][  ][ the same magnitude, whatever kind of 
body he may happen to use for the ][  ][ experiment. ][  ][ Rely
ing on his knowledge of the gravitational field (as it was ][  ]
[ discussed in the preceding section), the man in the chest will
 thus ][  ][ come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in
 a gravitational ][  ][ field which is constant with regard to t
ime. Of course he will be ][  ][ puzzled for a moment as to why 
the chest does not fall in this ][  ][ gravitational field. just
 then, however, he discovers the hook in the ][  ][ middle of th
e lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to it, ][  ][ 
and he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chest is ][
  ][ suspended at rest in the gravitational field. ][  ][ Ought 
we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion ? 
][  ][ I do not believe we ought to if we wish to remain consist
ent ; we must ][  ][ rather admit that his mode of grasping the 
situation violates neither ][  ][ reason nor known mechanical la
ws. Even though it is being accelerated ][  ][ with respect to t
he "Galileian space" first considered, we can ][  ][ nevertheles
s regard the chest as being at rest. We have thus good ][  ][ gr
ounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodie
s of ][  ][ reference which are accelerated with respect to each
 other, and as a ][  ][ result we have gained a powerful argumen
t for a generalised postulate ][  ][ of relativity. ][  ][ We mu
st note carefully that the possibility of this mode of ][  ][ in
terpretation rests on the fundamental property of the gravitatio
nal ][  ][ field of giving all bodies the same acceleration, or,
 what comes to ][  ][ the same thing, on the law of the equality
 of inertial and ][  ][ gravitational mass. If this natural law 
did not exist, the man in the ][  ][ accelerated chest would not
 be able to interpret the behaviour of the ][  ][ bodies around 
him on the supposition of a gravitational field, and he ][  ][ w
ould not be justified on the grounds of experience in supposing 
his ][  ][ reference-body to be " at rest." ][  ][ Suppose that 
the man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of ][  ][ th
e lid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope. 
The ][  ][ result of this will be to strech the rope so that it 
will hang " ][  ][ vertically " downwards. If we ask for an opin
ion of the cause of ][  ][ tension in the rope, the man in the c
hest will say: "The suspended ][  ][ body experiences a downward
 force in the gravitational field, and this ][  ][ is neutralise
d by the tension of the rope ; what determines the ][  ][ magnit
ude of the tension of the rope is the gravitational mass of the 
][  ][ suspended body." On the other hand, an observer who is po
ised freely ][  ][ in space will interpret the condition of thin
gs thus : " The rope must ][  ][ perforce take part in the accel
erated motion of the chest, and it ][  ][ transmits this motion 
to the body attached to it. The tension of the ][  ][ rope is ju
st large enough to effect the acceleration of the body. That ][ 
 ][ which determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is
 the ][  ][ inertial mass of the body." Guided by this example, 
we see that our ][  ][ extension of the principle of relativity 
implies the necessity of the ][  ][ law of the equality of inert
ial and gravitational mass. Thus we have ][  ][ obtained a physi
cal interpretation of this law. ][  ][ From our consideration of
 the accelerated chest we see that a general ][  ][ theory of re
lativity must yield important results on the laws of ][  ][ grav
itation. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of the general
 ][  ][ idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by th
e ][  ][ gravitational field. Before proceeding farther, however
, I must warn ][  ][ the reader against a misconception suggeste
d by these considerations. ][  ][ A gravitational field exists f
or the man in the chest, despite the ][  ][ fact that there was 
no such field for the co-ordinate system first ][  ][ chosen. No
w we might easily suppose that the existence of a ][  ][ gravita
tional field is always only an apparent one. We might also ][  ]
[ think that, regardless of the kind of gravitational field whic
h may be ][  ][ present, we could always choose another referenc
e-body such that no ][  ][ gravitational field exists with refer
ence to it. This is by no means ][  ][ true for all gravitationa
l fields, but only for those of quite special ][  ][ form. It is
, for instance, impossible to choose a body of reference ][  ][ 
such that, as judged from it, the gravitational field of the ear
th (in ][  ][ its entirety) vanishes. ][  ][ We can now apprecia
te why that argument is not convincing, which we ][  ][ brought 
forward against the general principle of relativity at theend ][
  ][ of Section 18. It is certainly true that the observer in th
e ][  ][ railway carriage experiences a jerk forwards as a resul
t of the ][  ][ application of the brake, and that he recognises
, in this the ][  ][ non-uniformity of motion (retardation) of t
he carriage. But he is ][  ][ compelled by nobody to refer this 
jerk to a " real " acceleration ][  ][ (retardation) of the carr
iage. He might also interpret his experience ][  ][ thus: " My b
ody of reference (the carriage) remains permanently at ][  ][ re
st. With reference to it, however, there exists (during the peri
od ][  ][ of application of the brakes) a gravitational field wh
ich is directed ][  ][ forwards and which is variable with respe
ct to time. Under the ][  ][ influence of this field, the embank
ment together with the earth moves ][  ][ non-uniformly in such 
a manner that their original velocity in the ][  ][ backwards di
rection is continuously reduced." ][  ][ IN WHAT RESPECTS ARE TH
E FOUNDATIONS OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND OF THE ][  ][ SPECIAL T
HEORY OF RELATIVITY UNSATISFACTORY? ][  ][ We have already state
d several times that classical mechanics starts ][  ][ out from 
the following law: Material particles sufficiently far ][  ][ re
moved from other material particles continue to move uniformly i
n a ][  ][ straight line or continue in a state of rest. We have
 also repeatedly ][  ][ emphasised that this fundamental law can
 only be valid for bodies of ][  ][ reference K which possess ce
rtain unique states of motion, and which ][  ][ are in uniform t
ranslational motion relative to each other. Relative ][  ][ to o
ther reference-bodies K the law is not valid. Both in classical 
][  ][ mechanics and in the special theory of relativity we ther
efore ][  ][ differentiate between reference-bodies K relative t
o which the ][  ][ recognised " laws of nature " can be said to 
hold, and ][  ][ reference-bodies K relative to which these laws
 do not hold. ][  ][ But no person whose mode of thought is logi
cal can rest satisfied with ][  ][ this condition of things. He 
asks : " How does it come that certain ][  ][ reference-bodies (
or their states of motion) are given priority over ][  ][ other 
reference-bodies (or their states of motion) ? What is the ][  ]
[ reason for this Preference? In order to show clearly what I me
an by ][  ][ this question, I shall make use of a comparison. ][
  ][ I am standing in front of a gas range. Standing alongside o
f each ][  ][ other on the range are two pans so much alike that
 one may be mistaken ][  ][ for the other. Both are half full of
 water. I notice that steam is ][  ][ being emitted continuously
 from the one pan, but not from the other. I ][  ][ am surprised
 at this, even if I have never seen either a gas range or ][  ][
 a pan before. But if I now notice a luminous something of bluis
h ][  ][ colour under the first pan but not under the other, I c
ease to be ][  ][ astonished, even if I have never before seen a
 gas flame. For I can ][  ][ only say that this bluish something
 will cause the emission of the ][  ][ steam, or at least possib
ly it may do so. If, however, I notice the ][  ][ bluish somethi
ng in neither case, and if I observe that the one ][  ][ continu
ously emits steam whilst the other does not, then I shall ][  ][
 remain astonished and dissatisfied until I have discovered some
 ][  ][ circumstance to which I can attribute the different beha
viour of the ][  ][ two pans. ][  ][ Analogously, I seek in vain
 for a real something in classical ][  ][ mechanics (or in the s
pecial theory of relativity) to which I can ][  ][ attribute the
 different behaviour of bodies considered with respect to ][  ][
 the reference systems K and K1.*  Newton saw this objection and
 ][  ][ attempted to invalidate it, but without success. But E. 
Mach recognsed ][  ][ it most clearly of all, and because of thi
s objection he claimed that ][  ][ mechanics must be placed on a
 new basis. It can only be got rid of by ][  ][ means of a physi
cs which is conformable to the general principle of ][  ][ relat
ivity, since the equations of such a theory hold for every body 
][  ][ of reference, whatever may be its state of motion. ][  ][
   Notes ][  ][ *) The objection is of importance more especiall
y when the state of ][  ][ motion of the reference-body is of su
ch a nature that it does not ][  ][ require any external agency 
for its maintenance, e.g. in the case when ][  ][ the reference-
body is rotating uniformly. ][  ][ A FEW INFERENCES FROM THE GEN
ERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ The considerations of Sectio
n 20 show that the general principle of ][  ][ relativity puts u
s in a position to derive properties of the ][  ][ gravitational
 field in a purely theoretical manner. Let us suppose, ][  ][ fo
r instance, that we know the space-time " course " for any natur
al ][  ][ process whatsoever, as regards the manner in which it 
takes place in ][  ][ the Galileian domain relative to a Galilei
an body of reference K. By ][  ][ means of purely theoretical op
erations (i.e. simply by calculation) we ][  ][ are then able to
 find how this known natural process appears, as seen ][  ][ fro
m a reference-body K1 which is accelerated relatively to K. But 
][  ][ since a gravitational field exists with respect to this n
ew body of ][  ][ reference K1, our consideration also teaches u
s how the gravitational ][  ][ field influences the process stud
ied. ][  ][ For example, we learn that a body which is in a stat
e of uniform ][  ][ rectilinear motion with respect to K (in acc
ordance with the law of ][  ][ Galilei) is executing an accelera
ted and in general curvilinear motion ][  ][ with respect to the
 accelerated reference-body K1 (chest). This ][  ][ acceleration
 or curvature corresponds to the influence on the moving ][  ][ 
body of the gravitational field prevailing relatively to K. It i
s ][  ][ known that a gravitational field influences the movemen
t of bodies in ][  ][ this way, so that our consideration suppli
es us with nothing ][  ][ essentially new. ][  ][ However, we ob
tain a new result of fundamental importance when we ][  ][ carry
 out the analogous consideration for a ray of light. With respec
t ][  ][ to the Galileian reference-body K, such a ray of light 
is transmitted ][  ][ rectilinearly with the velocity c. It can 
easily be shown that the ][  ][ path of the same ray of light is
 no longer a straight line when we ][  ][ consider it with refer
ence to the accelerated chest (reference-body ][  ][ K1). From t
his we conclude, that, in general, rays of light are ][  ][ prop
agated curvilinearly in gravitational fields. In two respects th
is ][  ][ result is of great importance. ][  ][ In the first pla
ce, it can be compared with the reality. Although a ][  ][ detai
led examination of the question shows that the curvature of ligh
t ][  ][ rays required by the general theory of relativity is on
ly exceedingly ][  ][ small for the gravitational fields at our 
disposal in practice, its ][  ][ estimated magnitude for light r
ays passing the sun at grazing ][  ][ incidence is nevertheless 
1.7 seconds of arc. This ought to manifest ][  ][ itself in the 
following way. As seen from the earth, certain fixed ][  ][ star
s appear to be in the neighbourhood of the sun, and are thus ][ 
 ][ capable of observation during a total eclipse of the sun. At
 such ][  ][ times, these stars ought to appear to be displaced 
outwards from the ][  ][ sun by an amount indicated above, as co
mpared with their apparent ][  ][ position in the sky when the s
un is situated at another part of the ][  ][ heavens. The examin
ation of the correctness or otherwise of this ][  ][ deduction i
s a problem of the greatest importance, the early solution ][  ]
[ of which is to be expected of astronomers.[2]* ][  ][ In the s
econd place our result shows that, according to the general ][  
][ theory of relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocit
y of ][  ][ light in vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fun
damental ][  ][ assumptions in the special theory of relativity 
and to which we have ][  ][ already frequently referred, cannot 
claim any unlimited validity. A ][  ][ curvature of rays of ligh
t can only take place when the velocity of ][  ][ propagation of
 light varies with position. Now we might think that as ][  ][ a
 consequence of this, the special theory of relativity and with 
it ][  ][ the whole theory of relativity would be laid in the du
st. But in ][  ][ reality this is not the case. We can only conc
lude that the special ][  ][ theory of relativity cannot claim a
n unlinlited domain of validity ; ][  ][ its results hold only s
o long as we are able to disregard the ][  ][ influences of grav
itational fields on the phenomena (e.g. of light). ][  ][ Since 
it has often been contended by opponents of the theory of ][  ][
 relativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown 
by the ][  ][ general theory of relativity, it is perhaps advisa
ble to make the ][  ][ facts of the case clearer by means of an 
appropriate comparison. ][  ][ Before the development of electro
dynamics the laws of electrostatics ][  ][ were looked upon as t
he laws of electricity. At the present time we ][  ][ know that 
electric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic ][  
][ considerations only for the case, which is never strictly rea
lised, in ][  ][ which the electrical masses are quite at rest r
elatively to each ][  ][ other, and to the co-ordinate system. S
hould we be justified in saying ][  ][ that for this reason elec
trostatics is overthrown by the ][  ][ field-equations of Maxwel
l in electrodynamics ? Not in the least. ][  ][ Electrostatics i
s contained in electrodynamics as a limiting case ; ][  ][ the l
aws of the latter lead directly to those of the former for the ]
[  ][ case in which the fields are invariable with regard to tim
e. No fairer ][  ][ destiny could be allotted to any physical th
eory, than that it should ][  ][ of itself point out the way to 
the introduction of a more ][  ][ comprehensive theory, in which
 it lives on as a limiting case. ][  ][ In the example of the tr
ansmission of light just dealt with, we have ][  ][ seen that th
e general theory of relativity enables us to derive ][  ][ theor
etically the influence of a gravitational field on the course of
 ][  ][ natural processes, the Iaws of which are already known w
hen a ][  ][ gravitational field is absent. But the most attract
ive problem, to the ][  ][ solution of which the general theory 
of relativity supplies the key, ][  ][ concerns the investigatio
n of the laws satisfied by the gravitational ][  ][ field itself
. Let us consider this for a moment. ][  ][ We are acquainted wi
th space-time domains which behave (approximately) ][  ][ in a "
 Galileian " fashion under suitable choice of reference-body, ][
  ][ i.e. domains in which gravitational fields are absent. If w
e now refer ][  ][ such a domain to a reference-body K1 possessi
ng any kind of motion, ][  ][ then relative to K1 there exists a
 gravitational field which is ][  ][ variable with respect to sp
ace and time.[3]**  The character of this ][  ][ field will of c
ourse depend on the motion chosen for K1. According to ][  ][ th
e general theory of relativity, the general law of the gravitati
onal ][  ][ field must be satisfied for all gravitational fields
 obtainable in ][  ][ this way. Even though by no means all grav
itationial fields can be ][  ][ produced in this way, yet we may
 entertain the hope that the general ][  ][ law of gravitation w
ill be derivable from such gravitational fields of ][  ][ a spec
ial kind. This hope has been realised in the most beautiful ][  
][ manner. But between the clear vision of this goal and its act
ual ][  ][ realisation it was necessary to surmount a serious di
fficulty, and as ][  ][ this lies deep at the root of things, I 
dare not withhold it from the ][  ][ reader. We require to exten
d our ideas of the space-time continuum ][  ][ still farther. ][
  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) By means of the star photographs of two e
xpeditions equipped by ][  ][ a Joint Committee of the Royal and
 Royal Astronomical Societies, the ][  ][ existence of the defle
ction of light demanded by theory was first ][  ][ confirmed dur
ing the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. (Cf. Appendix ][  ][ II
I.) ][  ][ **) This follows from a generalisation of the discuss
ion in ][  ][ Section 20 ][  ][ BEHAVIOUR OF CLOCKS AND MEASURIN
G-RODS ON A ROTATING BODY OF REFERENCE ][  ][ Hitherto I have pu
rposely refrained from speaking about the physical ][  ][ interp
retation of space- and time-data in the case of the general ][  
][ theory of relativity. As a consequence, I am guilty of a cert
ain ][  ][ slovenliness of treatment, which, as we know from the
 special theory ][  ][ of relativity, is far from being unimport
ant and pardonable. It is now ][  ][ high time that we remedy th
is defect; but I would mention at the ][  ][ outset, that this m
atter lays no small claims on the patience and on ][  ][ the pow
er of abstraction of the reader. ][  ][ We start off again from 
quite special cases, which we have frequently ][  ][ used before
. Let us consider a space time domain in which no ][  ][ gravita
tional field exists relative to a reference-body K whose state ]
[  ][ of motion has been suitably chosen. K is then a Galileian 
][  ][ reference-body as regards the domain considered, and the 
results of ][  ][ the special theory of relativity hold relative
 to K. Let us supposse ][  ][ the same domain referred to a seco
nd body of reference K1, which is ][  ][ rotating uniformly with
 respect to K. In order to fix our ideas, we ][  ][ shall imagin
e K1 to be in the form of a plane circular disc, which ][  ][ ro
tates uniformly in its own plane about its centre. An observer w
ho ][  ][ is sitting eccentrically on the disc K1 is sensible of
 a force which ][  ][ acts outwards in a radial direction, and w
hich would be interpreted as ][  ][ an effect of inertia (centri
fugal force) by an observer who was at ][  ][ rest with respect 
to the original reference-body K. But the observer ][  ][ on the
 disc may regard his disc as a reference-body which is " at rest
 ][  ][ " ; on the basis of the general principle of relativity 
he is ][  ][ justified in doing this. The force acting on himsel
f, and in fact on ][  ][ all other bodies which are at rest rela
tive to the disc, he regards as ][  ][ the effect of a gravitati
onal field. Nevertheless, the ][  ][ space-distribution of this 
gravitational field is of a kind that would ][  ][ not be possib
le on Newton's theory of gravitation.* But since the ][  ][ obse
rver believes in the general theory of relativity, this does not
 ][  ][ disturb him; he is quite in the right when he believes t
hat a general ][  ][ law of gravitation can be formulated- a law
 which not only explains ][  ][ the motion of the stars correctl
y, but also the field of force ][  ][ experienced by himself. ][
  ][ The observer performs experiments on his circular disc with
 clocks and ][  ][ measuring-rods. In doing so, it is his intent
ion to arrive at exact ][  ][ definitions for the signification 
of time- and space-data with ][  ][ reference to the circular di
sc K1, these definitions being based on ][  ][ his observations.
 What will be his experience in this enterprise ? ][  ][ To star
t with, he places one of two identically constructed clocks at ]
[  ][ the centre of the circular disc, and the other on the edge
 of the ][  ][ disc, so that they are at rest relative to it. We
 now ask ourselves ][  ][ whether both clocks go at the same rat
e from the standpoint of the ][  ][ non-rotating Galileian refer
ence-body K. As judged from this body, the ][  ][ clock at the c
entre of the disc has no velocity, whereas the clock at ][  ][ t
he edge of the disc is in motion relative to K in consequence of
 the ][  ][ rotation. According to a result obtained in Section 
12, it follows ][  ][ that the latter clock goes at a rate perma
nently slower than that of ][  ][ the clock at the centre of the
 circular disc, i.e. as observed from K. ][  ][ It is obvious th
at the same effect would be noted by an observer whom ][  ][ we 
will imagine sitting alongside his clock at the centre of the ][
  ][ circular disc. Thus on our circular disc, or, to make the c
ase more ][  ][ general, in every gravitational field, a clock w
ill go more quickly or ][  ][ less quickly, according to the pos
ition in which the clock is situated ][  ][ (at rest). For this 
reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable ][  ][ definiti
on of time with the aid of clocks which are arranged at rest ][ 
 ][ with respect to the body of reference. A similar difficulty 
presents ][  ][ itself when we attempt to apply our earlier defi
nition of simultaneity ][  ][ in such a case, but I do not wish 
to go any farther into this ][  ][ question. ][  ][ Moreover, at
 this stage the definition of the space co-ordinates also ][  ][
 presents insurmountable difficulties. If the observer applies h
is ][  ][ standard measuring-rod (a rod which is short as compar
ed with the ][  ][ radius of the disc) tangentially to the edge 
of the disc, then, as ][  ][ judged from the Galileian system, t
he length of this rod will be less ][  ][ than I, since, accordi
ng to Section 12, moving bodies suffer a ][  ][ shortening in th
e direction of the motion. On the other hand, the ][  ][ measari
ng-rod will not experience a shortening in length, as judged ][ 
 ][ from K, if it is applied to the disc in the direction of the
 radius. ][  ][ If, then, the observer first measures the circum
ference of the disc ][  ][ with his measuring-rod and then the d
iameter of the disc, on dividing ][  ][ the one by the other, he
 will not obtain as quotient the familiar ][  ][ number p = 3.14
 . . ., but a larger number,[4]** whereas of course, ][  ][ for 
a disc which is at rest with respect to K, this operation would 
][  ][ yield p exactly. This proves that the propositions of Euc
lidean ][  ][ geometry cannot hold exactly on the rotating disc,
 nor in general in a ][  ][ gravitational field, at least if we 
attribute the length I to the rod ][  ][ in all positions and in
 every orientation. Hence the idea of a ][  ][ straight line als
o loses its meaning. We are therefore not in a ][  ][ position t
o define exactly the co-ordinates x, y, z relative to the ][  ][
 disc by means of the method used in discussing the special theo
ry, and ][  ][ as long as the co- ordinates and times of events 
have not been ][  ][ defined, we cannot assign an exact meaning 
to the natural laws in ][  ][ which these occur. ][  ][ Thus all
 our previous conclusions based on general relativity would ][  
][ appear to be called in question. In reality we must make a su
btle ][  ][ detour in order to be able to apply the postulate of
 general ][  ][ relativity exactly. I shall prepare the reader f
or this in the ][  ][ following paragraphs. ][  ][   Notes ][  ]
[ *) The field disappears at the centre of the disc and increase
s ][  ][ proportionally to the distance from the centre as we pr
oceed outwards. ][  ][ **) Throughout this consideration we have
 to use the Galileian ][  ][ (non-rotating) system K as referenc
e-body, since we may only assume ][  ][ the validity of the resu
lts of the special theory of relativity ][  ][ relative to K (re
lative to K1 a gravitational field prevails). ][  ][ EUCLIDEAN A
ND NON-EUCLIDEAN CONTINUUM ][  ][ The surface of a marble table 
is spread out in front of me. I can get ][  ][ from any one poin
t on this table to any other point by passing ][  ][ continuousl
y from one point to a " neighbouring " one, and repeating ][  ][
 this process a (large) number of times, or, in other words, by 
going ][  ][ from point to point without executing "jumps." I am
 sure the reader ][  ][ will appreciate with sufficient clearnes
s what I mean here by " ][  ][ neighbouring " and by " jumps " (
if he is not too pedantic). We ][  ][ express this property of t
he surface by describing the latter as a ][  ][ continuum. ][  ]
[ Let us now imagine that a large number of little rods of equal
 length ][  ][ have been made, their lengths being small compare
d with the dimensions ][  ][ of the marble slab. When I say they
 are of equal length, I mean that ][  ][ one can be laid on any 
other without the ends overlapping. We next lay ][  ][ four of t
hese little rods on the marble slab so that they constitute a ][
  ][ quadrilateral figure (a square), the diagonals of which are
 equally ][  ][ long. To ensure the equality of the diagonals, w
e make use of a little ][  ][ testing-rod. To this square we add
 similar ones, each of which has one ][  ][ rod in common with t
he first. We proceed in like manner with each of ][  ][ these sq
uares until finally the whole marble slab is laid out with ][  ]
[ squares. The arrangement is such, that each side of a square b
elongs ][  ][ to two squares and each corner to four squares. ][
  ][ It is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this busines
s without ][  ][ getting into the greatest difficulties. We only
 need to think of the ][  ][ following. If at any moment three s
quares meet at a corner, then two ][  ][ sides of the fourth squ
are are already laid, and, as a consequence, ][  ][ the arrangem
ent of the remaining two sides of the square is already ][  ][ c
ompletely determined. But I am now no longer able to adjust the 
][  ][ quadrilateral so that its diagonals may be equal. If they
 are equal of ][  ][ their own accord, then this is an especial 
favour of the marble slab ][  ][ and of the little rods, about w
hich I can only be thankfully ][  ][ surprised. We must experien
ce many such surprises if the construction ][  ][ is to be succe
ssful. ][  ][ If everything has really gone smoothly, then I say
 that the points of ][  ][ the marble slab constitute a Euclidea
n continuum with respect to the ][  ][ little rod, which has bee
n used as a " distance " (line-interval). By ][  ][ choosing one
 corner of a square as " origin" I can characterise every ][  ][
 other corner of a square with reference to this origin by means
 of two ][  ][ numbers. I only need state how many rods I must p
ass over when, ][  ][ starting from the origin, I proceed toward
s the " right " and then " ][  ][ upwards," in order to arrive a
t the corner of the square under ][  ][ consideration. These two
 numbers are then the " Cartesian co-ordinates ][  ][ " of this 
corner with reference to the " Cartesian co-ordinate system" ][ 
 ][ which is determined by the arrangement of little rods. ][  ]
[ By making use of the following modification of this abstract ]
[  ][ experiment, we recognise that there must also be cases in 
which the ][  ][ experiment would be unsuccessful. We shall supp
ose that the rods " ][  ][ expand " by in amount proportional to
 the increase of temperature. We ][  ][ heat the central part of
 the marble slab, but not the periphery, in ][  ][ which case tw
o of our little rods can still be brought into ][  ][ coincidenc
e at every position on the table. But our construction of ][  ][
 squares must necessarily come into disorder during the heating,
 ][  ][ because the little rods on the central region of the tab
le expand, ][  ][ whereas those on the outer part do not. ][  ][
 With reference to our little rods -- defined as unit lengths --
 the ][  ][ marble slab is no longer a Euclidean continuum, and 
we are also no ][  ][ longer in the position of defining Cartesi
an co-ordinates directly ][  ][ with their aid, since the above 
construction can no longer be carried ][  ][ out. But since ther
e are other things which are not influenced in a ][  ][ similar 
manner to the little rods (or perhaps not at all) by the ][  ][ 
temperature of the table, it is possible quite naturally to main
tain ][  ][ the point of view that the marble slab is a " Euclid
ean continuum." ][  ][ This can be done in a satisfactory manner
 by making a more subtle ][  ][ stipulation about the measuremen
t or the comparison of lengths. ][  ][ But if rods of every kind
 (i.e. of every material) were to behave in ][  ][ the same way 
as regards the influence of temperature when they are on ][  ][ 
the variably heated marble slab, and if we had no other means of
 ][  ][ detecting the effect of temperature than the geometrical
 behaviour of ][  ][ our rods in experiments analogous to the on
e described above, then our ][  ][ best plan would be to assign 
the distance one to two points on the ][  ][ slab, provided that
 the ends of one of our rods could be made to ][  ][ coincide wi
th these two points ; for how else should we define the ][  ][ d
istance without our proceeding being in the highest measure gros
sly ][  ][ arbitrary ? The method of Cartesian coordinates must 
then be ][  ][ discarded, and replaced by another which does not
 assume the validity ][  ][ of Euclidean geometry for rigid bodi
es.*  The reader will notice ][  ][ that the situation depicted 
here corresponds to the one brought about ][  ][ by the general 
postitlate of relativity (Section 23). ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) 
Mathematicians have been confronted with our problem in the ][  
][ following form. If we are given a surface (e.g. an ellipsoid)
 in ][  ][ Euclidean three-dimensional space, then there exists 
for this surface ][  ][ a two-dimensional geometry, just as much
 as for a plane surface. Gauss ][  ][ undertook the task of trea
ting this two-dimensional geometry from ][  ][ first principles,
 without making use of the fact that the surface ][  ][ belongs 
to a Euclidean continuum of three dimensions. If we imagine ][  
][ constructions to be made with rigid rods in the surface (simi
lar to ][  ][ that above with the marble slab), we should find t
hat different laws ][  ][ hold for these from those resulting on
 the basis of Euclidean plane ][  ][ geometry. The surface is no
t a Euclidean continuum with respect to the ][  ][ rods, and we 
cannot define Cartesian co-ordinates in the surface. ][  ][ Gaus
s indicated the principles according to which we can treat the ]
[  ][ geometrical relationships in the surface, and thus pointed
 out the way ][  ][ to the method of Riemman of treating multi-d
imensional, non-Euclidean ][  ][ continuum. Thus it is that math
ematicians long ago solved the formal ][  ][ problems to which w
e are led by the general postulate of relativity. ][  ][ GAUSSIA
N CO-ORDINATES ][  ][ According to Gauss, this combined analytic
al and geometrical mode of ][  ][ handling the problem can be ar
rived at in the following way. We ][  ][ imagine a system of arb
itrary curves (see Fig. 4) drawn on the surface ][  ][ of the ta
ble. These we designate as u-curves, and we indicate each of ][ 
 ][ them by means of a number. The Curves u= 1, u= 2 and u= 3 ar
e drawn in ][  ][ the diagram. Between the curves u= 1 and u= 2 
we must imagine an ][  ][ infinitely large number to be drawn, a
ll of which correspond to real ][  ][ numbers lying between 1 an
d 2. fig. 04 We have then a system of ][  ][ u-curves, and this 
"infinitely dense" system covers the whole surface ][  ][ of the
 table. These u-curves must not intersect each other, and ][  ][
 through each point of the surface one and only one curve must p
ass. ][  ][ Thus a perfectly definite value of u belongs to ever
y point on the ][  ][ surface of the marble slab. In like manner
 we imagine a system of ][  ][ v-curves drawn on the surface. Th
ese satisfy the same conditions as ][  ][ the u-curves, they are
 provided with numbers in a corresponding ][  ][ manner, and the
y may likewise be of arbitrary shape. It follows that a ][  ][ v
alue of u and a value of v belong to every point on the surface 
of ][  ][ the table. We call these two numbers the co-ordinates 
of the surface ][  ][ of the table (Gaussian co-ordinates). For 
example, the point P in the ][  ][ diagram has the Gaussian co-o
rdinates u= 3, v= 1. Two neighbouring ][  ][ points P and P1 on 
the surface then correspond to the co-ordinates ][  ][          
              P:       u,v ][  ][                        P1:    
 u + du, v + dv, ][  ][ where du and dv signify very small numbe
rs. In a similar manner we may ][  ][ indicate the distance (lin
e-interval) between P and P1, as measured ][  ][ with a little r
od, by means of the very small number ds. Then ][  ][ according 
to Gauss we have ][  ][                 ds2 = g[11]du2 + 2g[12]d
udv = g[22]dv2 ][  ][ where g[11], g[12], g[22], are magnitudes 
which depend in a perfectly ][  ][ definite way on u and v. The 
magnitudes g[11], g[12] and g[22], ][  ][ determine the behaviou
r of the rods relative to the u-curves and ][  ][ v-curves, and 
thus also relative to the surface of the table. For the ][  ][ c
ase in which the points of the surface considered form a Euclide
an ][  ][ continuum with reference to the measuring-rods, but on
ly in this case, ][  ][ it is possible to draw the u-curves and 
v-curves and to attach numbers ][  ][ to them, in such a manner,
 that we simply have : ][  ][                            ds2 = d
u2 + dv2 ][  ][ Under these conditions, the u-curves and v-curve
s are straight lines ][  ][ in the sense of Euclidean geometry, 
and they are perpendicular to each ][  ][ other. Here the Gaussi
an coordinates are samply Cartesian ones. It is ][  ][ clear tha
t Gauss co-ordinates are nothing more than an association of ][ 
 ][ two sets of numbers with the points of the surface considere
d, of such ][  ][ a nature that numerical values differing very 
slightly from each other ][  ][ are associated with neighbouring
 points " in space." ][  ][ So far, these considerations hold fo
r a continuum of two dimensions. ][  ][ But the Gaussian method 
can be applied also to a continuum of three, ][  ][ four or more
 dimensions. If, for instance, a continuum of four ][  ][ dimens
ions be supposed available, we may represent it in the following
 ][  ][ way. With every point of the continuum, we associate arb
itrarily four ][  ][ numbers, x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], which are 
known as " co-ordinates." ][  ][ Adjacent points correspond to a
djacent values of the coordinates. If a ][  ][ distance ds is as
sociated with the adjacent points P and P1, this ][  ][ distance
 being measurable and well defined from a physical point of ][  
][ view, then the following formula holds: ][  ][ ds2 = g[11]dx[
1]^2 + 2g[12]dx[1]dx[2] . . . . g[44]dx[4]^2, ][  ][ where the m
agnitudes g[11], etc., have values which vary with the ][  ][ po
sition in the continuum. Only when the continuum is a Euclidean 
one ][  ][ is it possible to associate the co-ordinates x[1] . .
 x[4]. with the ][  ][ points of the continuum so that we have s
imply ][  ][ ds2 = dx[1]^2 + dx[2]^2 + dx[3]^2 + dx[4]^2. ][  ][
 In this case relations hold in the four-dimensional continuum w
hich ][  ][ are analogous to those holding in our three-dimensio
nal measurements. ][  ][ However, the Gauss treatment for ds2 wh
ich we have given above is not ][  ][ always possible. It is onl
y possible when sufficiently small regions ][  ][ of the continu
um under consideration may be regarded as Euclidean ][  ][ conti
nua. For example, this obviously holds in the case of the marble
 ][  ][ slab of the table and local variation of temperature. Th
e temperature ][  ][ is practically constant for a small part of
 the slab, and thus the ][  ][ geometrical behaviour of the rods
 is almost as it ought to be ][  ][ according to the rules of Eu
clidean geometry. Hence the imperfections ][  ][ of the construc
tion of squares in the previous section do not show ][  ][ thems
elves clearly until this construction is extended over a ][  ][ 
considerable portion of the surface of the table. ][  ][ We can 
sum this up as follows: Gauss invented a method for the ][  ][ m
athematical treatment of continua in general, in which " ][  ][ 
size-relations " (" distances " between neighbouring points) are
 ][  ][ defined. To every point of a continuum are assigned as m
any numbers ][  ][ (Gaussian coordinates) as the continuum has d
imensions. This is done ][  ][ in such a way, that only one mean
ing can be attached to the ][  ][ assignment, and that numbers (
Gaussian coordinates) which differ by an ][  ][ indefinitely sma
ll amount are assigned to adjacent points. The ][  ][ Gaussian c
oordinate system is a logical generalisation of the ][  ][ Carte
sian co-ordinate system. It is also applicable to non-Euclidean 
][  ][ continua, but only when, with respect to the defined "siz
e" or ][  ][ "distance," small parts of the continuum under cons
ideration behave ][  ][ more nearly like a Euclidean system, the
 smaller the part of the ][  ][ continuum under our notice. ][  
][ THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM OF THE SPEICAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 
CONSIDERED AS A ][  ][ EUCLIDEAN CONTINUUM ][  ][ We are now in 
a position to formulate more exactly the idea of ][  ][ Minkowsk
i, which was only vaguely indicated in Section 17. In ][  ][ acc
ordance with the special theory of relativity, certain co-ordina
te ][  ][ systems are given preference for the description of th
e ][  ][ four-dimensional, space-time continuum. We called these
 " Galileian ][  ][ co-ordinate systems." For these systems, the
 four co-ordinates x, y, ][  ][ z, t, which determine an event o
r -- in other words, a point of the ][  ][ four-dimensional cont
inuum -- are defined physically in a simple ][  ][ manner, as se
t forth in detail in the first part of this book. For the ][  ][
 transition from one Galileian system to another, which is movin
g ][  ][ uniformly with reference to the first, the equations of
 the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation are valid. These last form th
e basis for the derivation ][  ][ of deductions from the special
 theory of relativity, and in themselves ][  ][ they are nothing
 more than the expression of the universal validity of ][  ][ th
e law of transmission of light for all Galileian systems of ][  
][ reference. ][  ][ Minkowski found that the Lorentz transforma
tions satisfy the following ][  ][ simple conditions. Let us con
sider two neighbouring events, the ][  ][ relative position of w
hich in the four-dimensional continuum is given ][  ][ with resp
ect to a Galileian reference-body K by the space co-ordinate ][ 
 ][ differences dx, dy, dz and the time-difference dt. With refe
rence to a ][  ][ second Galileian system we shall suppose that 
the corresponding ][  ][ differences for these two events are dx
1, dy1, dz1, dt1. Then these ][  ][ magnitudes always fulfil the
 condition* ][  ][      dx2 + dy2 + dz2 - c^2dt2 = dx1 2 + dy1 2
 + dz1 2 - c^2dt1 2. ][  ][ The validity of the Lorentz transfor
mation follows from this ][  ][ condition. We can express this a
s follows: The magnitude ][  ][                    ds2 = dx2 + d
y2 + dz2 - c^2dt2, ][  ][ which belongs to two adjacent points o
f the four-dimensional ][  ][ space-time continuum, has the same
 value for all selected (Galileian) ][  ][ reference-bodies. If 
we replace x, y, z, sq. rt. -I . ct , by x[1], ][  ][ x[2], x[3]
, x[4], we also obtaill the result that ][  ][              ds2 
= dx[1]^2 + dx[2]^2 + dx[3]^2 + dx[4]^2. ][  ][ is independent o
f the choice of the body of reference. We call the ][  ][ magnit
ude ds the " distance " apart of the two events or ][  ][ four-d
imensional points. ][  ][ Thus, if we choose as time-variable th
e imaginary variable sq. rt. -I ][  ][ . ct instead of the real 
quantity t, we can regard the space-time ][  ][ contintium -- ac
cordance with the special theory of relativity -- as a ][  ][ ",
 Euclidean " four-dimensional continuum, a result which follows 
from ][  ][ the considerations of the preceding section. ][  ][ 
  Notes ][  ][ *) Cf. Appendixes I and 2. The relations which ar
e derived ][  ][ there for the co-ordlnates themselves are valid
 also for co-ordinate ][  ][ differences, and thus also for co-o
rdinate differentials (indefinitely ][  ][ small differences). ]
[  ][ THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF REALTIIV
TY IS NOT A ][  ][ ECULIDEAN CONTINUUM ][  ][ In the first part 
of this book we were able to make use of space-time ][  ][ co-or
dinates which allowed of a simple and direct physical ][  ][ int
erpretation, and which, according to Section 26, can be regarded
 ][  ][ as four-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. This was pos
sible on the ][  ][ basis of the law of the constancy of the vel
ocity of tight. But ][  ][ according to Section 21 the general t
heory of relativity cannot ][  ][ retain this law. On the contra
ry, we arrived at the result that ][  ][ according to this latte
r theory the velocity of light must always ][  ][ depend on the 
co-ordinates when a gravitational field is present. In ][  ][ co
nnection with a specific illustration in Section 23, we found ][
  ][ that the presence of a gravitational field invalidates the 
definition ][  ][ of the coordinates and the ifine, which led us
 to our objective in the ][  ][ special theory of relativity. ][
  ][ In view of the resuIts of these considerations we are led t
o the ][  ][ conviction that, according to the general principle
 of relativity, the ][  ][ space-time continuum cannot be regard
ed as a Euclidean one, but that ][  ][ here we have the general 
case, corresponding to the marble slab with ][  ][ local variati
ons of temperature, and with which we made acquaintance ][  ][ a
s an example of a two-dimensional continuum. Just as it was ther
e ][  ][ impossible to construct a Cartesian co-ordinate system 
from equal ][  ][ rods, so here it is impossible to build up a s
ystem (reference-body) ][  ][ from rigid bodies and clocks, whic
h shall be of such a nature that ][  ][ measuring-rods and clock
s, arranged rigidly with respect to one ][  ][ another, shaIll i
ndicate position and time directly. Such was the ][  ][ essence 
of the difficulty with which we were confronted in Section ][  ]
[ 23. ][  ][ But the considerations of Sections 25 and 26 show u
s the way to ][  ][ surmount this difficulty. We refer the fourd
imensional space-time ][  ][ continuum in an arbitrary manner to
 Gauss co-ordinates. We assign to ][  ][ every point of the cont
inuum (event) four numbers, x[1], x[2], x[3], ][  ][ x[4] (co-or
dinates), which have not the least direct physical ][  ][ signif
icance, but only serve the purpose of numbering the points of ][
  ][ the continuum in a definite but arbitrary manner. This arra
ngement ][  ][ does not even need to be of such a kind that we m
ust regard x[1], ][  ][ x[2], x[3], as "space" co-ordinates and 
x[4], as a " time " ][  ][ co-ordinate. ][  ][ The reader may th
ink that such a description of the world would be ][  ][ quite i
nadequate. What does it mean to assign to an event the ][  ][ pa
rticular co-ordinates x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], if in themselves t
hese ][  ][ co-ordinates have no significance ? More careful con
sideration shows, ][  ][ however, that this anxiety is unfounded
. Let us consider, for ][  ][ instance, a material point with an
y kind of motion. If this point had ][  ][ only a momentary exis
tence without duration, then it would to ][  ][ described in spa
ce-time by a single system of values x[1], x[2], x[3], ][  ][ x[
4]. Thus its permanent existence must be characterised by an ][ 
 ][ infinitely large number of such systems of values, the co-or
dinate ][  ][ values of which are so close together as to give c
ontinuity; ][  ][ corresponding to the material point, we thus h
ave a (uni-dimensional) ][  ][ line in the four-dimensional cont
inuum. In the same way, any such ][  ][ lines in our continuum c
orrespond to many points in motion. The only ][  ][ statements h
aving regard to these points which can claim a physical ][  ][ e
xistence are in reality the statements about their encounters. I
n our ][  ][ mathematical treatment, such an encounter is expres
sed in the fact ][  ][ that the two lines which represent the mo
tions of the points in ][  ][ question have a particular system 
of co-ordinate values, x[1], x[2], ][  ][ x[3], x[4], in common.
 After mature consideration the reader will ][  ][ doubtless adm
it that in reality such encounters constitute the only ][  ][ ac
tual evidence of a time-space nature with which we meet in physi
cal ][  ][ statements. ][  ][ When we were describing the motion
 of a material point relative to a ][  ][ body of reference, we 
stated nothing more than the encounters of this ][  ][ point wit
h particular points of the reference-body. We can also ][  ][ de
termine the corresponding values of the time by the observation 
of ][  ][ encounters of the body with clocks, in conjunction wit
h the ][  ][ observation of the encounter of the hands of clocks
 with particular ][  ][ points on the dials. It is just the same
 in the case of ][  ][ space-measurements by means of measuring-
rods, as a litttle ][  ][ consideration will show. ][  ][ The fo
llowing statements hold generally : Every physical description ]
[  ][ resolves itself into a number of statements, each of which
 refers to ][  ][ the space-time coincidence of two events A and
 B. In terms of Gaussian ][  ][ co-ordinates, every such stateme
nt is expressed by the agreement of ][  ][ their four co-ordinat
es x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4]. Thus in reality, the ][  ][ descripti
on of the time-space continuum by means of Gauss co-ordinates ][
  ][ completely replaces the description with the aid of a body 
of ][  ][ reference, without suffering from the defects of the l
atter mode of ][  ][ description; it is not tied down to the Euc
lidean character of the ][  ][ continuum which has to be represe
nted. ][  ][ EXACT FORMULATION OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELAT
IVITY ][  ][ We are now in a position to replace the pro. vision
al formulation of ][  ][ the general principle of relativity giv
en in Section 18 by an exact ][  ][ formulation. The form there 
used, "All bodies of reference K, K1, ][  ][ etc., are equivalen
t for the description of natural phenomena ][  ][ (formulation o
f the general laws of nature), whatever may be their ][  ][ stat
e of motion," cannot be maintained, because the use of rigid ][ 
 ][ reference-bodies, in the sense of the method followed in the
 special ][  ][ theory of relativity, is in general not possible
 in space-time ][  ][ description. The Gauss co-ordinate system 
has to take the place of the ][  ][ body of reference. The follo
wing statement corresponds to the ][  ][ fundamental idea of the
 general principle of relativity: "All Gaussian ][  ][ co-ordina
te systems are essentially equivalent for the formulation of ][ 
 ][ the general laws of nature." ][  ][ We can state this genera
l principle of relativity in still another ][  ][ form, which re
nders it yet more clearly intelligible than it is when ][  ][ in
 the form of the natural extension of the special principle of ]
[  ][ relativity. According to the special theory of relativity,
 the ][  ][ equations which express the general laws of nature p
ass over into ][  ][ equations of the same form when, by making 
use of the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation, we replace the space-t
ime variables x, y, z, t, of a ][  ][ (Galileian) reference-body
 K by the space-time variables x1, y1, z1, ][  ][ t1, of a new r
eference-body K1. According to the general theory of ][  ][ rela
tivity, on the other hand, by application of arbitrary ][  ][ su
bstitutions of the Gauss variables x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], the ]
[  ][ equations must pass over into equations of the same form; 
for every ][  ][ transformation (not only the Lorentz transforma
tion) corresponds to ][  ][ the transition of one Gauss co-ordin
ate system into another. ][  ][ If we desire to adhere to our "o
ld-time" three-dimensional view of ][  ][ things, then we can ch
aracterise the development which is being ][  ][ undergone by th
e fundamental idea of the general theory of relativity ][  ][ as
 follows : The special theory of relativity has reference to ][ 
 ][ Galileian domains, i.e. to those in which no gravitational f
ield ][  ][ exists. In this connection a Galileian reference-bod
y serves as body ][  ][ of reference, i.e. a rigid body the stat
e of motion of which is so ][  ][ chosen that the Galileian law 
of the uniform rectilinear motion of ][  ][ "isolated" material 
points holds relatively to it. ][  ][ Certain considerations sug
gest that we should refer the same Galileian ][  ][ domains to n
on-Galileian reference-bodies also. A gravitational field ][  ][
 of a special kind is then present with respect to these bodies 
(cf. ][  ][ Sections 20 and 23). ][  ][ In gravitational fields 
there are no such things as rigid bodies with ][  ][ Euclidean p
roperties; thus the fictitious rigid body of reference is ][  ][
 of no avail in the general theory of relativity. The motion of 
clocks ][  ][ is also influenced by gravitational fields, and in
 such a way that a ][  ][ physical definition of time which is m
ade directly with the aid of ][  ][ clocks has by no means the s
ame degree of plausibility as in the ][  ][ special theory of re
lativity. ][  ][ For this reason non-rigid reference-bodies are 
used, which are as a ][  ][ whole not only moving in any way wha
tsoever, but which also suffer ][  ][ alterations in form ad lib
. during their motion. Clocks, for which the ][  ][ law of motio
n is of any kind, however irregular, serve for the ][  ][ defini
tion of time. We have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a
 ][  ][ point on the non-rigid reference-body. These clocks sati
sfy only the ][  ][ one condition, that the "readings" which are
 observed simultaneously ][  ][ on adjacent clocks (in space) di
ffer from each other by an ][  ][ indefinitely small amount. Thi
s non-rigid reference-body, which might ][  ][ appropriately be 
termed a "reference-mollusc", is in the main ][  ][ equivalent t
o a Gaussian four-dimensional co-ordinate system chosen ][  ][ a
rbitrarily. That which gives the "mollusc" a certain ][  ][ comp
rehensibility as compared with the Gauss co-ordinate system is t
he ][  ][ (really unjustified) formal retention of the separate 
existence of the ][  ][ space co-ordinates as opposed to the tim
e co-ordinate. Every point on ][  ][ the mollusc is treated as a
 space-point, and every material point ][  ][ which is at rest r
elatively to it as at rest, so long as the mollusc ][  ][ is con
sidered as reference-body. The general principle of relativity ]
[  ][ requires that all these molluscs can be used as reference-
bodies with ][  ][ equal right and equal success in the formulat
ion of the general laws ][  ][ of nature; the laws themselves mu
st be quite independent of the choice ][  ][ of mollusc. ][  ][ 
The great power possessed by the general principle of relativity
 lies ][  ][ in the comprehensive limitation which is imposed on
 the laws of nature ][  ][ in consequence of what we have seen a
bove. ][  ][ THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF GRAVITATION ON THE B
ASIS OF THE GENERAL ][  ][ PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ If the
 reader has followed all our previous considerations, he will ][
  ][ have no further difficulty in understanding the methods lea
ding to the ][  ][ solution of the problem of gravitation. ][  ]
[ We start off on a consideration of a Galileian domain, i.e. a 
domain ][  ][ in which there is no gravitational field relative 
to the Galileian ][  ][ reference-body K. The behaviour of measu
ring-rods and clocks with ][  ][ reference to K is known from th
e special theory of relativity, ][  ][ likewise the behaviour of
 "isolated" material points; the latter move ][  ][ uniformly an
d in straight lines. ][  ][ Now let us refer this domain to a ra
ndom Gauss coordinate system or to ][  ][ a "mollusc" as referen
ce-body K1. Then with respect to K1 there is a ][  ][ gravitatio
nal field G (of a particular kind). We learn the behaviour ][  ]
[ of measuring-rods and clocks and also of freely-moving materia
l points ][  ][ with reference to K1 simply by mathematical tran
sformation. We ][  ][ interpret this behaviour as the behaviour 
of measuring-rods, docks and ][  ][ material points tinder the i
nfluence of the gravitational field G. ][  ][ Hereupon we introd
uce a hypothesis: that the influence of the ][  ][ gravitational
 field on measuringrods, clocks and freely-moving ][  ][ materia
l points continues to take place according to the same laws, ][ 
 ][ even in the case where the prevailing gravitational field is
 not ][  ][ derivable from the Galfleian special care, simply by
 means of a ][  ][ transformation of co-ordinates. ][  ][ The ne
xt step is to investigate the space-time behaviour of the ][  ][
 gravitational field G, which was derived from the Galileian spe
cial ][  ][ case simply by transformation of the coordinates. Th
is behaviour is ][  ][ formulated in a law, which is always vali
d, no matter how the ][  ][ reference-body (mollusc) used in the
 description may be chosen. ][  ][ This law is not yet the gener
al law of the gravitational field, since ][  ][ the gravitationa
l field under consideration is of a special kind. In ][  ][ orde
r to find out the general law-of-field of gravitation we still ]
[  ][ require to obtain a generalisation of the law as found abo
ve. This can ][  ][ be obtained without caprice, however, by tak
ing into consideration the ][  ][ following demands: ][  ][ (a) 
The required generalisation must likewise satisfy the general ][
  ][ postulate of relativity. ][  ][ (b) If there is any matter 
in the domain under consideration, only its ][  ][ inertial mass
, and thus according to Section 15 only its energy is ][  ][ of 
importance for its etfect in exciting a field. ][  ][ (c) Gravit
ational field and matter together must satisfy the law of ][  ][
 the conservation of energy (and of impulse). ][  ][ Finally, th
e general principle of relativity permits us to determine ][  ][
 the influence of the gravitational field on the course of all t
hose ][  ][ processes which take place according to known laws w
hen a ][  ][ gravitational field is absent i.e. which have alrea
dy been fitted into ][  ][ the frame of the special theory of re
lativity. In this connection we ][  ][ proceed in principle acco
rding to the method which has already been ][  ][ explained for 
measuring-rods, clocks and freely moving material ][  ][ points.
 ][  ][ The theory of gravitation derived in this way from the g
eneral ][  ][ postulate of relativity excels not only in its bea
uty ; nor in ][  ][ removing the defect attaching to classical m
echanics which was brought ][  ][ to light in Section 21; nor in
 interpreting the empirical law of ][  ][ the equality of inerti
al and gravitational mass ; but it has also ][  ][ already expla
ined a result of observation in astronomy, against which ][  ][ 
classical mechanics is powerless. ][  ][ If we confine the appli
cation of the theory to the case where the ][  ][ gravitational 
fields can be regarded as being weak, and in which all ][  ][ ma
sses move with respect to the coordinate system with velocities 
][  ][ which are small compared with the velocity of light, we t
hen obtain as ][  ][ a first approximation the Newtonian theory.
 Thus the latter theory is ][  ][ obtained here without any part
icular assumption, whereas Newton had to ][  ][ introduce the hy
pothesis that the force of attraction between mutually ][  ][ at
tracting material points is inversely proportional to the square
 of ][  ][ the distance between them. If we increase the accurac
y of the ][  ][ calculation, deviations from the theory of Newto
n make their ][  ][ appearance, practically all of which must ne
vertheless escape the test ][  ][ of observation owing to their 
smallness. ][  ][ We must draw attention here to one of these de
viations. According to ][  ][ Newton's theory, a planet moves ro
und the sun in an ellipse, which ][  ][ would permanently mainta
in its position with respect to the fixed ][  ][ stars, if we co
uld disregard the motion of the fixed stars themselves ][  ][ an
d the action of the other planets under consideration. Thus, if 
we ][  ][ correct the observed motion of the planets for these t
wo influences, ][  ][ and if Newton's theory be strictly correct
, we ought to obtain for the ][  ][ orbit of the planet an ellip
se, which is fixed with reference to the ][  ][ fixed stars. Thi
s deduction, which can be tested with great accuracy, ][  ][ has
 been confirmed for all the planets save one, with the precision
 ][  ][ that is capable of being obtained by the delicacy of obs
ervation ][  ][ attainable at the present time. The sole excepti
on is Mercury, the ][  ][ planet which lies nearest the sun. Sin
ce the time of Leverrier, it has ][  ][ been known that the elli
pse corresponding to the orbit of Mercury, ][  ][ after it has b
een corrected for the influences mentioned above, is not ][  ][ 
stationary with respect to the fixed stars, but that it rotates 
][  ][ exceedingly slowly in the plane of the orbit and in the s
ense of the ][  ][ orbital motion. The value obtained for this r
otary movement of the ][  ][ orbital ellipse was 43 seconds of a
rc per century, an amount ensured ][  ][ to be correct to within
 a few seconds of arc. This effect can be ][  ][ explained by me
ans of classical mechanics only on the assumption of ][  ][ hypo
theses which have little probability, and which were devised ][ 
 ][ solely for this purponse. ][  ][ On the basis of the general
 theory of relativity, it is found that the ][  ][ ellipse of ev
ery planet round the sun must necessarily rotate in the ][  ][ m
anner indicated above ; that for all the planets, with the excep
tion ][  ][ of Mercury, this rotation is too small to be detecte
d with the ][  ][ delicacy of observation possible at the presen
t time ; but that in the ][  ][ case of Mercury it must amount t
o 43 seconds of arc per century, a ][  ][ result which is strict
ly in agreement with observation. ][  ][ Apart from this one, it
 has hitherto been possible to make only two ][  ][ deductions f
rom the theory which admit of being tested by observation, ][  ]
[ to wit, the curvature of light rays by the gravitational field
 of the ][  ][ sun,*x and a displacement of the spectral lines o
f light reaching ][  ][ us from large stars, as compared with th
e corresponding lines for ][  ][ light produced in an analogous 
manner terrestrially (i.e. by the same ][  ][ kind of atom).**  
These two deductions from the theory have both ][  ][ been confi
rmed. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) First observed by Eddington and o

 ][ CONSIDERATIONS ON THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE ][  ][ COSMOLOGICA
L DIFFICULTIES OF NEWTON'S THEORY ][  ][ Part from the difficult
y discussed in Section 21, there is a second ][  ][ fundamental 
difficulty attending classical celestial mechanics, which, ][  ]
[ to the best of my knowledge, was first discussed in detail by 
the ][  ][ astronomer Seeliger. If we ponder over the question a
s to how the ][  ][ universe, considered as a whole, is to be re
garded, the first answer ][  ][ that suggests itself to us is su
rely this: As regards space (and time) ][  ][ the universe is in
finite. There are stars everywhere, so that the ][  ][ density o
f matter, although very variable in detail, is nevertheless ][  
][ on the average everywhere the same. In other words: However f
ar we ][  ][ might travel through space, we should find everywhe
re an attenuated ][  ][ swarm of fixed stars of approrimately th
e same kind and density. ][  ][ This view is not in harmony with
 the theory of Newton. The latter ][  ][ theory rather requires 
that the universe should have a kind of centre ][  ][ in which t
he density of the stars is a maximum, and that as we proceed ][ 
 ][ outwards from this centre the group-density of the stars sho
uld ][  ][ diminish, until finally, at great distances, it is su
cceeded by an ][  ][ infinite region of emptiness. The stellar u
niverse ought to be a ][  ][ finite island in the infinite ocean
 of space.* ][  ][ This conception is in itself not very satisfa
ctory. It is still less ][  ][ satisfactory because it leads to 
the result that the light emitted by ][  ][ the stars and also i
ndividual stars of the stellar system are ][  ][ perpetually pas
sing out into infinite space, never to return, and ][  ][ withou
t ever again coming into interaction with other objects of ][  ]
[ nature. Such a finite material universe would be destined to b
ecome ][  ][ gradually but systematically impoverished. ][  ][ I
n order to escape this dilemma, Seeliger suggested a modificatio
n of ][  ][ Newton's law, in which he assumes that for great dis
tances the force ][  ][ of attraction between two masses diminis
hes more rapidly than would ][  ][ result from the inverse squar
e law. In this way it is possible for the ][  ][ mean density of
 matter to be constant everywhere, even to infinity, ][  ][ with
out infinitely large gravitational fields being produced. We thu
s ][  ][ free ourselves from the distasteful conception that the
 material ][  ][ universe ought to possess something of the natu
re of a centre. Of ][  ][ course we purchase our emancipation fr
om the fundamental difficulties ][  ][ mentioned, at the cost of
 a modification and complication of Newton's ][  ][ law which ha
s neither empirical nor theoretical foundation. We can ][  ][ im
agine innumerable laws which would serve the same purpose, witho
ut ][  ][ our being able to state a reason why one of them is to
 be preferred to ][  ][ the others ; for any one of these laws w
ould be founded just as little ][  ][ on more general theoretica
l principles as is the law of Newton. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) P
roof -- According to the theory of Newton, the number of "lines 
][  ][ of force" which come from infinity and terminate in a mas
s m is ][  ][ proportional to the mass m. If, on the average, th
e Mass density p[0] ][  ][ is constant throughout tithe universe
, then a sphere of volume V will ][  ][ enclose the average man 
p[0]V. Thus the number of lines of force ][  ][ passing through 
the surface F of the sphere into its interior is ][  ][ proporti
onal to p[0] V. For unit area of the surface of the sphere the ]
[  ][ number of lines of force which enters the sphere is thus p
roportional ][  ][ to p[0] V/F or to p[0]R. Hence the intensity 
of the field at the ][  ][ surface would ultimately become infin
ite with increasing radius R of ][  ][ the sphere, which is impo
ssible. ][  ][ THE POSSIBILITY OF A "FINITE" AND YET "UNBOUNDED"
 UNIVERSE ][  ][ But speculations on the structure of the univer
se also move in quite ][  ][ another direction. The development 
of non-Euclidean geometry led to ][  ][ the recognition of the f
act, that we can cast doubt on the ][  ][ infiniteness of our sp
ace without coming into conflict with the laws ][  ][ of thought
 or with experience (Riemann, Helmholtz). These questions ][  ][
 have already been treated in detail and with unsurpassable luci
dity by ][  ][ Helmholtz and Poincar?, whereas I can only touch 
on them briefly here. ][  ][ In the first place, we imagine an e
xistence in two dimensional space. ][  ][ Flat beings with flat 
implements, and in particular flat rigid ][  ][ measuring-rods, 
are free to move in a plane. For them nothing exists ][  ][ outs
ide of this plane: that which they observe to happen to themselv
es ][  ][ and to their flat " things " is the all-inclusive real
ity of their ][  ][ plane. In particular, the constructions of p
lane Euclidean geometry ][  ][ can be carried out by means of th
e rods e.g. the lattice construction, ][  ][ considered in Secti
on 24. In contrast to ours, the universe of ][  ][ these beings 
is two-dimensional; but, like ours, it extends to ][  ][ infinit
y. In their universe there is room for an infinite number of ][ 
 ][ identical squares made up of rods, i.e. its volume (surface)
 is ][  ][ infinite. If these beings say their universe is " pla
ne," there is ][  ][ sense in the statement, because they mean t
hat they can perform the ][  ][ constructions of plane Euclidean
 geometry with their rods. In this ][  ][ connection the individ
ual rods always represent the same distance, ][  ][ independentl
y of their position. ][  ][ Let us consider now a second two-dim
ensional existence, but this time ][  ][ on a spherical surface 
instead of on a plane. The flat beings with ][  ][ their measuri
ng-rods and other objects fit exactly on this surface and ][  ][
 they are unable to leave it. Their whole universe of observatio
n ][  ][ extends exclusively over the surface of the sphere. Are
 these beings ][  ][ able to regard the geometry of their univer
se as being plane geometry ][  ][ and their rods withal as the r
ealisation of " distance " ? They cannot ][  ][ do this. For if 
they attempt to realise a straight line, they will ][  ][ obtain
 a curve, which we " three-dimensional beings " designate as a ]
[  ][ great circle, i.e. a self-contained line of definite finit
e length, ][  ][ which can be measured up by means of a measurin
g-rod. Similarly, this ][  ][ universe has a finite area that ca
n be compared with the area, of a ][  ][ square constructed with
 rods. The great charm resulting from this ][  ][ consideration 
lies in the recognition of the fact that the universe of ][  ][ 
these beings is finite and yet has no limits. ][  ][ But the sph
erical-surface beings do not need to go on a world-tour in ][  ]
[ order to perceive that they are not living in a Euclidean univ
erse. ][  ][ They can convince themselves of this on every part 
of their " world," ][  ][ provided they do not use too small a p
iece of it. Starting from a ][  ][ point, they draw " straight l
ines " (arcs of circles as judged in ][  ][ three dimensional sp
ace) of equal length in all directions. They will ][  ][ call th
e line joining the free ends of these lines a " circle." For a ]
[  ][ plane surface, the ratio of the circumference of a circle 
to its ][  ][ diameter, both lengths being measured with the sam
e rod, is, according ][  ][ to Euclidean geometry of the plane, 
equal to a constant value p, which ][  ][ is independent of the 
diameter of the circle. On their spherical ][  ][ surface our fl
at beings would find for this ratio the value ][  ][            
             eq. 27: file eq27.gif ][  ][ i.e. a smaller value t
han p, the difference being the more ][  ][ considerable, the gr
eater is the radius of the circle in comparison ][  ][ with the 
radius R of the " world-sphere." By means of this relation ][  ]
[ the spherical beings can determine the radius of their univers
e (" ][  ][ world "), even when only a relatively small part of 
their worldsphere ][  ][ is available for their measurements. Bu
t if this part is very small ][  ][ indeed, they will no longer 
be able to demonstrate that they are on a ][  ][ spherical " wor
ld " and not on a Euclidean plane, for a small part of ][  ][ a 
spherical surface differs only slightly from a piece of a plane 
of ][  ][ the same size. ][  ][ Thus if the spherical surface be
ings are living on a planet of which ][  ][ the solar system occ
upies only a negligibly small part of the ][  ][ spherical unive
rse, they have no means of determining whether they are ][  ][ l
iving in a finite or in an infinite universe, because the " piec
e of ][  ][ universe " to which they have access is in both case
s practically ][  ][ plane, or Euclidean. It follows directly fr
om this discussion, that ][  ][ for our sphere-beings the circum
ference of a circle first increases ][  ][ with the radius until
 the " circumference of the universe " is ][  ][ reached, and th
at it thenceforward gradually decreases to zero for ][  ][ still
 further increasing values of the radius. During this process th
e ][  ][ area of the circle continues to increase more and more,
 until finally ][  ][ it becomes equal to the total area of the 
whole " world-sphere." ][  ][ Perhaps the reader will wonder why
 we have placed our " beings " on a ][  ][ sphere rather than on
 another closed surface. But this choice has its ][  ][ justific
ation in the fact that, of all closed surfaces, the sphere is ][
  ][ unique in possessing the property that all points on it are
 ][  ][ equivalent. I admit that the ratio of the circumference 
c of a circle ][  ][ to its radius r depends on r, but for a giv
en value of r it is the ][  ][ same for all points of the " worl
dsphere "; in other words, the " ][  ][ world-sphere " is a " su
rface of constant curvature." ][  ][ To this two-dimensional sph
ere-universe there is a three-dimensional ][  ][ analogy, namely
, the three-dimensional spherical space which was ][  ][ discove
red by Riemann. its points are likewise all equivalent. It ][  ]
[ possesses a finite volume, which is determined by its "radius"
 ][  ][ (2p2R3). Is it possible to imagine a spherical space? To
 imagine a ][  ][ space means nothing else than that we imagine 
an epitome of our " ][  ][ space " experience, i.e. of experienc
e that we can have in the ][  ][ movement of " rigid " bodies. I
n this sense we can imagine a spherical ][  ][ space. ][  ][ Sup
pose we draw lines or stretch strings in all directions from a ]
[  ][ point, and mark off from each of these the distance r with
 a ][  ][ measuring-rod. All the free end-points of these length
s lie on a ][  ][ spherical surface. We can specially measure up
 the area (F) of this ][  ][ surface by means of a square made u
p of measuring-rods. If the ][  ][ universe is Euclidean, then F
 = 4pR2 ; if it is spherical, then F is ][  ][ always less than 
4pR2. With increasing values of r, F increases from ][  ][ zero 
up to a maximum value which is determined by the " world-radius,
" ][  ][ but for still further increasing values of r, the area 
gradually ][  ][ diminishes to zero. At first, the straight line
s which radiate from ][  ][ the starting point diverge farther a
nd farther from one another, but ][  ][ later they approach each
 other, and finally they run together again at ][  ][ a "counter
-point" to the starting point. Under such conditions they ][  ][
 have traversed the whole spherical space. It is easily seen tha
t the ][  ][ three-dimensional spherical space is quite analogou
s to the ][  ][ two-dimensional spherical surface. It is finite 
(i.e. of finite ][  ][ volume), and has no bounds. ][  ][ It may
 be mentioned that there is yet another kind of curved space: " 
][  ][ elliptical space." It can be regarded as a curved space i
n which the ][  ][ two " counter-points " are identical (indisti
nguishable from each ][  ][ other). An elliptical universe can t
hus be considered to some extent ][  ][ as a curved universe pos
sessing central symmetry. ][  ][ It follows from what has been s
aid, that closed spaces without limits ][  ][ are conceivable. F
rom amongst these, the spherical space (and the ][  ][ elliptica
l) excels in its simplicity, since all points on it are ][  ][ e
quivalent. As a result of this discussion, a most interesting ][
  ][ question arises for astronomers and physicists, and that is
 whether ][  ][ the universe in which we live is infinite, or wh
ether it is finite in ][  ][ the manner of the spherical univers
e. Our experience is far from being ][  ][ sufficient to enable 
us to answer this question. But the general ][  ][ theory of rel
ativity permits of our answering it with a moduate degree ][  ][
 of certainty, and in this connection the difficulty mentioned i
n ][  ][ Section 30 finds its solution. ][  ][ THE STRUCTURE OF 
SPACE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ Accor
ding to the general theory of relativity, the geometrical ][  ][
 properties of space are not independent, but they are determine
d by ][  ][ matter. Thus we can draw conclusions about the geome
trical structure ][  ][ of the universe only if we base our cons
iderations on the state of the ][  ][ matter as being something 
that is known. We know from experience that, ][  ][ for a suitab
ly chosen co-ordinate system, the velocities of the stars ][  ][
 are small as compared with the velocity of transmission of ligh
t. We ][  ][ can thus as a rough approximation arrive at a concl
usion as to the ][  ][ nature of the universe as a whole, if we 
treat the matter as being at ][  ][ rest. ][  ][ We already know
 from our previous discussion that the behaviour of ][  ][ measu
ring-rods and clocks is influenced by gravitational fields, i.e.
 ][  ][ by the distribution of matter. This in itself is suffici
ent to exclude ][  ][ the possibility of the exact validity of E
uclidean geometry in our ][  ][ universe. But it is conceivable 
that our universe differs only ][  ][ slightly from a Euclidean 
one, and this notion seems all the more ][  ][ probable, since c
alculations show that the metrics of surrounding ][  ][ space is
 influenced only to an exceedingly small extent by masses even ]
[  ][ of the magnitude of our sun. We might imagine that, as reg
ards ][  ][ geometry, our universe behaves analogously to a surf
ace which is ][  ][ irregularly curved in its individual parts, 
but which nowhere departs ][  ][ appreciably from a plane: somet
hing like the rippled surface of a ][  ][ lake. Such a universe 
might fittingly be called a quasi-Euclidean ][  ][ universe. As 
regards its space it would be infinite. But calculation ][  ][ s
hows that in a quasi-Euclidean universe the average density of m
atter ][  ][ would necessarily be nil. Thus such a universe coul
d not be inhabited ][  ][ by matter everywhere ; it would presen
t to us that unsatisfactory ][  ][ picture which we portrayed in
 Section 30. ][  ][ If we are to have in the universe an average
 density of matter which ][  ][ differs from zero, however small
 may be that difference, then the ][  ][ universe cannot be quas
i-Euclidean. On the contrary, the results of ][  ][ calculation 
indicate that if matter be distributed uniformly, the ][  ][ uni
verse would necessarily be spherical (or elliptical). Since in ]
[  ][ reality the detailed distribution of matter is not uniform
, the real ][  ][ universe will deviate in individual parts from
 the spherical, i.e. the ][  ][ universe will be quasi-spherical
. But it will be necessarily finite. ][  ][ In fact, the theory 
supplies us with a simple connection *  between ][  ][ the space
-expanse of the universe and the average density of matter in ][
  ][ it. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) For the radius R of the univer

 systems indicated in ][  ][ Fig. 2, the x-axes of both systems 
pernumently coincide. In the ][  ][ present case we can divide t

ented with respect to the co-ordinate system K by the abscissa x
 ][  ][ and the time t, and with respect to the system K1 by the
 abscissa x' ][  ][ and the time t'. We require to find x' and t
' when x and t are given. ][  ][ A light-signal, which is procee
ding along the positive axis of x, is ][  ][ transmitted accordi
ng to the equation ][  ][                                 x = ct

   (1). ][  ][ Since the same light-signal has to be transmitted
 relative to K1 with ][  ][ the velocity c, the propagation rela
tive to the system K1 will be ][  ][ represented by the analogou
s formula ][  ][                 x' - ct' = O     .     .     . 
   (2) ][  ][ Those space-time points (events) which satisfy (x)
 must also satisfy ][  ][ (2). Obviously this will be the case w

cates a constant ; for, according ][  ][ to (3), the disappearan

[  ][ If we call v the velocity with which the origin of K1 is m

        eq. 33: file eq33.gif ][  ][ The same value v can be obt
ained from equations (5), if we calculate ][  ][ the velocity of
 another point of K1 relative to K, or the velocity ][  ][ (dire
cted towards the negative x-axis) of a point of K with respect t
o ][  ][ K'. In short, we can designate v as the relative veloci
ty of the two ][  ][ systems. ][  ][ Furthermore, the principle 
of relativity teaches us that, as judged ][  ][ from K, the leng
th of a unit measuring-rod which is at rest with ][  ][ referenc

[  ][ K', of a unit measuring-rod which is at rest relative to K
. In order ][  ][ to see how the points of the x-axis appear as 
viewed from K, we only ][  ][ require to take a " snapshot " of 
K1 from K; this means that we have ][  ][ to insert a particular
 value of t (time of K), e.g. t = 0. For this ][  ][ value of t 
we then obtain from the first of the equations (5) ][  ][       
                         x' = ax ][  ][ Two points of the x'-axi

this way we satisfy the postulate of the constancy of the veloci
ty ][  ][ of light in vacuo for rays of light of arbitrary direc
tion, both for ][  ][ the system K and for the system K'. This m
ay be shown in the following ][  ][ manner. ][  ][ We suppose a 
light-signal sent out from the origin of K at the time t ][  ][ 
= 0. It will be propagated according to the equation ][  ][     
                    eq. 40: file eq40.gif ][  ][ or, if we squar
e this equation, according to the equation ][  ][           x2 +
 y2 + z2 = c^2t2 = 0    .     .     .    (10). ][  ][ It is requ
ired by the law of propagation of light, in conjunction with ][ 
 ][ the postulate of relativity, that the transmission of the si
gnal in ][  ][ question should take place -- as judged from K1 -
- in accordance with ][  ][ the corresponding formula ][  ][    
                            r' = ct' ][  ][ or, ][  ][        x'
2 + y'2 + z'2 - c^2t'2 = 0    .     .     .    (10a). ][  ][ In 
order that equation (10a) may be a consequence of equation (10),
 we ][  ][ must have ][  ][    x'2 + y'2 + z'2 - c^2t'2 = s (x2 
+ y2 + z2 - c^2t2)       (11). ][  ][ Since equation (8a) must h
old for points on the x-axis, we thus have s ][  ][ = I. It is e
asily seen that the Lorentz transformation really ][  ][ satisfi
es equation (11) for s = I; for (11) is a consequence of (8a) ][
  ][ and (9), and hence also of (8) and (9). We have thus derive
d the ][  ][ Lorentz transformation. ][  ][ The Lorentz transfor
mation represented by (8) and (9) still requires ][  ][ to be ge
neralised. Obviously it is immaterial whether the axes of K1 ][ 
 ][ be chosen so that they are spatially parallel to those of K.
 It is ][  ][ also not essential that the velocity of translatio
n of K1 with respect ][  ][ to K should be in the direction of t
he x-axis. A simple consideration ][  ][ shows that we are able 
to construct the Lorentz transformation in this ][  ][ general s
ense from two kinds of transformations, viz. from Lorentz ][  ][
 transformations in the special sense and from purely spatial ][
  ][ transformations. which corresponds to the replacement of th
e ][  ][ rectangular co-ordinate system by a new system with its
 axes pointing ][  ][ in other directions. ][  ][ Mathematically
, we can characterise the generalised Lorentz ][  ][ transformat
ion thus : ][  ][ It expresses x', y', x', t', in terms of linea
r homogeneous functions ][  ][ of x, y, x, t, of such a kind tha
t the relation ][  ][      x'2 + y'2 + z'2 - c^2t'2 = x2 + y2 + 
z2 - c^2t2       (11a). ][  ][ is satisficd identically. That is
 to say: If we substitute their ][  ][ expressions in x, y, x, t
, in place of x', y', x', t', on the ][  ][ left-hand side, then
 the left-hand side of (11a) agrees with the ][  ][ right-hand s
ide. ][  ][ APPENDIX II ][  ][ MINKOWSKI'S FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPAC
E ("WORLD") ][  ][ (SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION 17) ][  ][ We can c
haracterise the Lorentz transformation still more simply if we ]
[  ][ introduce the imaginary eq. 25 in place of t, as time-vari
able. If, in ][  ][ accordance with this, we insert ][  ][      
                         x[1] = x ][  ][

larly for the accented system K1, then the condition which is ][

d thus : ][  ][ x[1]'2 + x[2]'2 + x[3]'2 + x[4]'2 = x[1]^2 + x[2
]^2 + x[3]^2 + x[4]^2 ][  ][     (12). ][  ][ That is, by the af
ore-mentioned choice of " coordinates," (11a) [see ][  ][ the en
d of Appendix II] is transformed into this equation. ][  ][ We s
ee from (12) that the imaginary time co-ordinate x[4], enters in
to ][  ][ the condition of transformation in exactly the same wa
y as the space ][  ][ co-ordinates x[1], x[2], x[3]. It is due t
o this fact that, according ][  ][ to the theory of relativity, 
the " time "x[4], enters into natural ][  ][ laws in the same fo
rm as the space co ordinates x[1], x[2], x[3]. ][  ][ A four-dim
ensional continuum described by the "co-ordinates" x[1], ][  ][ 
x[2], x[3], x[4], was called "world" by Minkowski, who also term
ed a ][  ][ point-event a " world-point." From a "happening" in 
three-dimensional ][  ][ space, physics becomes, as it were, an 
" existence " in the ][  ][ four-dimensional " world." ][  ][ Th
is four-dimensional " world " bears a close similarity to the ][

try. If we ][  ][ introduce into the latter a new Cartesian co-o

RMATION OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ From a system
atic theoretical point of view, we may imagine the ][  ][ proces
s of evolution of an empirical science to be a continuous ][  ][
 process of induction. Theories are evolved and are expressed in
 short ][  ][ compass as statements of a large number of individ
ual observations in ][  ][ the form of empirical laws, from whic
h the general laws can be ][  ][ ascertained by comparison. Rega
rded in this way, the development of a ][  ][ science bears some
 resemblance to the compilation of a classified ][  ][ catalogue
. It is, as it were, a purely empirical enterprise. ][  ][ But t
his point of view by no means embraces the whole of the actual ]
[  ][ process ; for it slurs over the important part played by i
ntuition and ][  ][ deductive thought in the development of an e
xact science. As soon as a ][  ][ science has emerged from its i
nitial stages, theoretical advances are ][  ][ no longer achieve
d merely by a process of arrangement. Guided by ][  ][ empirical
 data, the investigator rather develops a system of thought ][  
][ which, in general, is built up logically from a small number 
of ][  ][ fundamental assumptions, the so-called axioms. We call
 such a system ][  ][ of thought a theory. The theory finds the 
justification for its ][  ][ existence in the fact that it corre
lates a large number of single ][  ][ observations, and it is ju
st here that the " truth " of the theory ][  ][ lies. ][  ][ Cor
responding to the same complex of empirical data, there may be ]
[  ][ several theories, which differ from one another to a consi
derable ][  ][ extent. But as regards the deductions from the th
eories which are ][  ][ capable of being tested, the agreement b
etween the theories may be so ][  ][ complete that it becomes di
fficult to find any deductions in which the ][  ][ two theories 
differ from each other. As an example, a case of general ][  ][ 
interest is available in the province of biology, in the Darwini
an ][  ][ theory of the development of species by selection in t
he struggle for ][  ][ existence, and in the theory of developme
nt which is based on the ][  ][ hypothesis of the hereditary tra
nsmission of acquired characters. ][  ][ We have another instanc
e of far-reaching agreement between the ][  ][ deductions from t
wo theories in Newtonian mechanics on the one hand, ][  ][ and t
he general theory of relativity on the other. This agreement goe
s ][  ][ so far, that up to the preseat we have been able to fin
d only a few ][  ][ deductions from the general theory of relati
vity which are capable of ][  ][ investigation, and to which the
 physics of pre-relativity days does ][  ][ not also lead, and t
his despite the profound difference in the ][  ][ fundamental as
sumptions of the two theories. In what follows, we shall ][  ][ 
again consider these important deductions, and we shall also dis
cuss ][  ][ the empirical evidence appertaining to them which ha
s hitherto been ][  ][ obtained. ][  ][  (a) Motion of the Perih
elion of Mercury ][  ][ According to Newtonian mechanics and New
ton's law of gravitation, a ][  ][ planet which is revolving rou
nd the sun would describe an ellipse ][  ][ round the latter, or
, more correctly, round the common centre of ][  ][ gravity of t
he sun and the planet. In such a system, the sun, or the ][  ][ 
common centre of gravity, lies in one of the foci of the orbital
 ][  ][ ellipse in such a manner that, in the course of a planet
-year, the ][  ][ distance sun-planet grows from a minimum to a 
maximum, and then ][  ][ decreases again to a minimum. If instea
d of Newton's law we insert a ][  ][ somewhat different law of a
ttraction into the calculation, we find ][  ][ that, according t
o this new law, the motion would still take place in ][  ][ such
 a manner that the distance sun-planet exhibits periodic ][  ][ 
variations; but in this case the angle described by the line joi
ning ][  ][ sun and planet during such a period (from perihelion
--closest ][  ][ proximity to the sun--to perihelion) would diff
er from 360^0. The line ][  ][ of the orbit would not then be a 
closed one but in the course of time ][  ][ it would fill up an 
annular part of the orbital plane, viz. between ][  ][ the circl
e of least and the circle of greatest distance of the planet ][ 
 ][ from the sun. ][  ][ According also to the general theory of
 relativity, which differs of ][  ][ course from the theory of N
ewton, a small variation from the ][  ][ Newton-Kepler motion of
 a planet in its orbit should take place, and ][  ][ in such awa
y, that the angle described by the radius sun-planet ][  ][ betw
een one perhelion and the next should exceed that corresponding 
to ][  ][ one complete revolution by an amount given by ][  ][  
                       eq. 41: file eq41.gif ][  ][ (N.B. -- One
 complete revolution corresponds to the angle 2p in the ][  ][ a
bsolute angular measure customary in physics, and the above ][  
][ expression giver the amount by which the radius sun-planet ex
ceeds ][  ][ this angle during the interval between one periheli
on and the next.) ][  ][ In this expression a represents the maj
or semi-axis of the ellipse, e ][  ][ its eccentricity, c the ve
locity of light, and T the period of ][  ][ revolution of the pl
anet. Our result may also be stated as follows : ][  ][ Accordin
g to the general theory of relativity, the major axis of the ][ 
 ][ ellipse rotates round the sun in the same sense as the orbit
al motion ][  ][ of the planet. Theory requires that this rotati
on should amount to 43 ][  ][ seconds of arc per century for the
 planet Mercury, but for the other ][  ][ Planets of our solar s
ystem its magnitude should be so small that it ][  ][ would nece
ssarily escape detection. * ][  ][ In point of fact, astronomers
 have found that the theory of Newton ][  ][ does not suffice to
 calculate the observed motion of Mercury with an ][  ][ exactne
ss corresponding to that of the delicacy of observation ][  ][ a
ttainable at the present time. After taking account of all the ]
[  ][ disturbing influences exerted on Mercury by the remaining 
planets, it ][  ][ was found (Leverrier: 1859; and Newcomb: 1895
) that an unexplained ][  ][ perihelial movement of the orbit of
 Mercury remained over, the amount ][  ][ of which does not diff
er sensibly from the above mentioned +43 seconds ][  ][ of arc p
er century. The uncertainty of the empirical result amounts to ]
[  ][ a few seconds only. ][  ][  (b) Deflection of Light by a G
ravitational Field ][  ][ In Section 22 it has been already ment
ioned that according to the ][  ][ general theory of relativity,
 a ray of light will experience a ][  ][ curvature of its path w
hen passing through a gravitational field, this ][  ][ curvature
 being similar to that experienced by the path of a body ][  ][ 
which is projected through a gravitational field. As a result of
 this ][  ][ theory, we should expect that a ray of light which 
is passing close to ][  ][ a heavenly body would be deviated tow
ards the latter. For a ray of ][  ][ light which passes the sun 
at a distance of D sun-radii from its ][  ][ centre, the angle o
f deflection (a) should amount to ][  ][                        
 eq. 42: file eq42.gif ][  ][ It may be added that, according to
 the theory, half of Figure 05 this ][  ][ deflection is produce
d by the Newtonian field of attraction of the ][  ][ sun, and th
e other half by the geometrical modification (" curvature ][  ][
 ") of space caused by the sun. ][  ][ This result admits of an 
experimental test by means of the ][  ][ photographic registrati
on of stars during a total eclipse of the sun. ][  ][ The only r
eason why we must wait for a total eclipse is because at ][  ][ 
every other time the atmosphere is so strongly illuminated by th
e ][  ][ light from the sun that the stars situated near the sun
's disc are ][  ][ invisible. The predicted effect can be seen c
learly from the ][  ][ accompanying diagram. If the sun (S) were
 not present, a star which is ][  ][ practically infinitely dist
ant would be seen in the direction D[1], as ][  ][ observed fron
t the earth. But as a consequence of the deflection of ][  ][ li
ght from the star by the sun, the star will be seen in the direc
tion ][  ][ D[2], i.e. at a somewhat greater distance from the c
entre of the sun ][  ][ than corresponds to its real position. ]
[  ][ In practice, the question is tested in the following way. 
The stars in ][  ][ the neighbourhood of the sun are photographe
d during a solar eclipse. ][  ][ In addition, a second photograp
h of the same stars is taken when the ][  ][ sun is situated at 
another position in the sky, i.e. a few months ][  ][ earlier or
 later. As compared whh the standard photograph, the ][  ][ posi
tions of the stars on the eclipse-photograph ought to appear ][ 
 ][ displaced radially outwards (away from the centre of the sun
) by an ][  ][ amount corresponding to the angle a. ][  ][ We ar
e indebted to the [British] Royal Society and to the Royal ][  ]
[ Astronomical Society for the investigation of this important ]
[  ][ deduction. Undaunted by the [first world] war and by diffi
culties of ][  ][ both a material and a psychological nature aro
used by the war, these ][  ][ societies equipped two expeditions
 -- to Sobral (Brazil), and to the ][  ][ island of Principe (We
st Africa) -- and sent several of Britain's most ][  ][ celebrat
ed astronomers (Eddington, Cottingham, Crommelin, Davidson), ][ 
 ][ in order to obtain photographs of the solar eclipse of 29th 
May, 1919. ][  ][ The relative discrepancies to be expected betw
een the stellar ][  ][ photographs obtained during the eclipse a
nd the comparison photographs ][  ][ amounted to a few hundredth
s of a millimetre only. Thus great accuracy ][  ][ was necessary
 in making the adjustments required for the taking of the ][  ][
 photographs, and in their subsequent measurement. ][  ][ The re
sults of the measurements confirmed the theory in a thoroughly ]
[  ][ satisfactory manner. The rectangular components of the obs
erved and of ][  ][ the calculated deviations of the stars (in s
econds of arc) are set ][  ][ forth in the following table of re

 ][ In the first place, we see from this expression that two clo
cks of ][  ][ identical construction will go at different rates 
when situated at ][  ][ different distances from the centre of t
he disc. This result is aiso ][  ][ valid from the standpoint of
 an observer who is rotating with the ][  ][ disc. ][  ][ Now, a
s judged from the disc, the latter is in a gravititional field ]
[  ][ of potential f, hence the result we have obtained will hol
d quite ][  ][ generally for gravitational fields. Furthermore, 
we can regard an atom ][  ][ which is emitting spectral lines as
 a clock, so that the following ][  ][ statement will hold: ][  
][ An atom absorbs or emits light of a frequency which is depend
ent on ][  ][ the potential of the gravitational field in which 
it is situated. ][  ][ The frequency of an atom situated on the 
surface of a heavenly body ][  ][ will be somewhat less than the
 frequency of an atom of the same ][  ][ element which is situat
ed in free space (or on the surface of a ][  ][ smaller celestia
l body). ][  ][ Now f = - K (M/r), where K is Newton's constant 
of gravitation, and M ][  ][ is the mass of the heavenly body. T
hus a displacement towards the red ][  ][ ought to take place fo
r spectral lines produced at the surface of ][  ][ stars as comp
ared with the spectral lines of the same element produced ][  ][
 at the surface of the earth, the amount of this displacement be

For the sun, the displacement towards the red predicted by theor
y ][  ][ amounts to about two millionths of the wave-length. A t
rustworthy ][  ][ calculation is not possible in the case of the
 stars, because in ][  ][ general neither the mass M nor the rad
ius r are known. ][  ][ It is an open question whether or not th
is effect exists, and at the ][  ][ present time (1920) astronom
ers are working with great zeal towards ][  ][ the solution. Owi
ng to the smallness of the effect in the case of the ][  ][ sun,
 it is difficult to form an opinion as to its existence. Whereas
 ][  ][ Grebe and Bachem (Bonn), as a result of their own measur
ements and ][  ][ those of Evershed and Schwarzschild on the cya
nogen bands, have placed ][  ][ the existence of the effect almo
st beyond doubt, while other ][  ][ investigators, particularly 
St. John, have been led to the opposite ][  ][ opinion in conseq
uence of their measurements. ][  ][ Mean displacements of lines 
towards the less refrangible end of the ][  ][ spectrum are cert
ainly revealed by statistical investigations of the ][  ][ fixed
 stars ; but up to the present the examination of the available 
][  ][ data does not allow of any definite decision being arrive
d at, as to ][  ][ whether or not these displacements are to be 
referred in reality to ][  ][ the effect of gravitation. The res
ults of observation have been ][  ][ collected together, and dis
cussed in detail from the standpoint of the ][  ][ question whic
h has been engaging our attention here, in a paper by E. ][  ][ 
Freundlich entitled "Zur Pr?fung der allgemeinen ][  ][ Relativi
t&umlaut;ts-Theorie" (Die Naturwissenschaften, 1919, No. 35, ][ 
 ][ p. 520: Julius Springer, Berlin). ][  ][ At all events, a de
finite decision will be reached during the next few ][  ][ years
. If the displacement of spectral lines towards the red by the ]
[  ][ gravitational potential does not exist, then the general t
heory of ][  ][ relativity will be untenable. On the other hand,
 if the cause of the ][  ][ displacement of spectral lines be de
finitely traced to the ][  ][ gravitational potential, then the 
study of this displacement will ][  ][ furnish us with important
 information as to the mass of the heavenly ][  ][ bodies. [5][A

s has an orbit that is ][  ][ almost an exact circle, which make
s it more difficult to locate the ][  ][ perihelion with precisi
on. ][  ][ The displacentent of spectral lines towards the red e
nd of the ][  ][ spectrum was definitely established by Adams in
 1924, by observations ][  ][ on the dense companion of Sirius, 
for which the effect is about thirty ][  ][ times greater than f
or the Sun. R.W.L. -- translator ][  ][ APPENDIX IV ][  ][ THE S
TRUCTURE OF SPACE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 
][  ][ (SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION 32) ][  ][ Since the publicatio
n of the first edition of this little book, our ][  ][ knowledge
 about the structure of space in the large (" cosmological ][  ]
[ problem ") has had an important development, which ought to be
 ][  ][ mentioned even in a popular presentation of the subject.
 ][  ][ My original considerations on the subject were based on 
two ][  ][ hypotheses: ][  ][ (1) There exists an average densit
y of matter in the whole of space ][  ][ which is everywhere the
 same and different from zero. ][  ][ (2) The magnitude (" radiu
s ") of space is independent of time. ][  ][ Both these hypothes
es proved to be consistent, according to the ][  ][ general theo
ry of relativity, but only after a hypothetical term was ][  ][ 
added to the field equations, a term which was not required by t
he ][  ][ theory as such nor did it seem natural from a theoreti
cal point of ][  ][ view (" cosmological term of the field equat
ions "). ][  ][ Hypothesis (2) appeared unavoidable to me at the
 time, since I thought ][  ][ that one would get into bottomless
 speculations if one departed from ][  ][ it. ][  ][ However, al
ready in the 'twenties, the Russian mathematician Friedman ][  ]
[ showed that a different hypothesis was natural from a purely ]
[  ][ theoretical point of view. He realized that it was possibl
e to ][  ][ preserve hypothesis (1) without introducing the less
 natural ][  ][ cosmological term into the field equations of gr
avitation, if one was ][  ][ ready to drop hypothesis (2). Namel
y, the original field equations ][  ][ admit a solution in which
 the " world radius " depends on time ][  ][ (expanding space). 
In that sense one can say, according to Friedman, ][  ][ that th
e theory demands an expansion of space. ][  ][ A few years later
 Hubble showed, by a special investigation of the ][  ][ extra-g
alactic nebulae (" milky ways "), that the spectral lines ][  ][
 emitted showed a red shift which increased regularly with the d
istance ][  ][ of the nebulae. This can be interpreted in regard
 to our present ][  ][ knowledge only in the sense of Doppler's 
principle, as an expansive ][  ][ motion of the system of stars 
in the large -- as required, according ][  ][ to Friedman, by th
e field equations of gravitation. Hubble's discovery ][  ][ can,
 therefore, be considered to some extent as a confirmation of th
e ][  ][ theory. ][  ][ There does arise, however, a strange dif
ficulty. The interpretation of ][  ][ the galactic line-shift di
scovered by Hubble as an expansion (which ][  ][ can hardly be d
oubted from a theoretical point of view), leads to an ][  ][ ori
gin of this expansion which lies " only " about 10^9 years ago, 
][  ][ while physical astronomy makes it appear likely that the 
development ][  ][ of individual stars and systems of stars take
s considerably longer. It ][  ][ is in no way known how this inc
ongruity is to be overcome. ][  ][ I further want to rernark tha
t the theory of expanding space, together ][  ][ with the empiri
cal data of astronomy, permit no decision to be reached ][  ][ a
bout the finite or infinite character of (three-dimensional) spa
ce, ][  ][ while the original " static " hypothesis of space yie
lded the closure ][  ][ (finiteness) of space. ][  ][ K = co-ord
