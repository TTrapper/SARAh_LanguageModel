Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (ne Byron; 10 December 1815  27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, ]
[  ][ chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. ][ Sh
e  ][ was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, ][ and published the first algorithm
 inten ][ ded to be carried out by such a machine. ][ As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full 
potential  ][ of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.[2][3][4] ][ Lovelace was the only legitimate child of 
the poet Lord  ][ Byron and his wife Anne Isabella "Annabella" Milbanke, Lady Wentworth.[5] ][ All of Byron's other children wer
e born out of wedl ][ ock to other women.[6] ][ Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England foreve
r four months later. ] ][ [ He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, "Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA
! sole daughter of my hous ][ e and heart?".[7] ][ He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years 
old. ][ Her mother remained bi ][ tter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from dev
eloping her father's perceived ins ][ anity. ][ Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron and was, upon her eventual death,
 buried next to him at her request. ][ ][  She was often ill in her childhood. ][ Ada married William King in 1835. King was mad
e Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby be ][ coming Countess of Lovelace. ][ Her educational and social exploits brought her in
to contact with scientists such as Andrew Cros ][ se, Sir David Brewster, ][ Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author 
Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to furthe ][ r her education. ][ Ada described her approach as "poetical science"[8] an
d herself as an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)".[9] ][ Whe ][ n she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long worki
ng relationship and friendship with fellow British mathema ][ tician Charles Babbage, ][ also known as "the father of computers"
, and in particular, Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine.  ][ ][ Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual f
riend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville. ][ Between 1842 and ][  1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engin
eer Luigi Menabrea on the engine, ][ supplementing it with an elaborat ][ e set of notes, simply called Notes. ][ These notes co
ntain what many consider to be the first computer programthat is, an algo ][ rithm designed to be carried out by a machine. ][ L
ovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. ][ She also  ][ developed a vision of the capability of compute
rs to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, ][ inclu ][ ding Babbage himself, focused only on those
 capabilities.[10] ][ Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions abou ][ t the Analytical Engine (as shown in he
r notes) ][ examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative ][  tool.[6] ][
