tended, as far as possible, to give an exact ][  ][ insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a ][  ] ][ 
[ general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in ][  ][ the theory, but who are not conversant with the m
 ][ athematical apparatus ][  ][ of theoretical physics. The work presumes a standard of education ][  ][ corresponding to that 
of a ][  university matriculation examination, and, ][  ][ despite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and forc
e ][  ][ ][  of will on the part of the reader. The author has spared himself no ][  ][ pains in his endeavour to present the ma
in ideas in  ][ the simplest and ][  ][ most intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and ][  ][ connection in which
 they actually o ][ riginated. In the interest of ][  ][ clearness, it appeared to me inevitable that I should repeat myself ][ 
 ][ frequently, with ][ out paying the slightest attention to the elegance of ][  ][ the presentation. I adhered scrupulously to
 the precept of that ][  ][  ][ brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom ][  ][ matters of elegance ought
 to be left to the tailor an ][ d to the cobbler. ][  ][ I make no pretence of having withheld from the reader difficulties ][  
][ which are inherent to the sub ][ ject. On the other hand, I have purposely ][  ][ treated the empirical physical foundations 
of the theory in a ][  ][ "step-moth ][ erly" fashion, so that readers unfamiliar with physics may ][  ][ not feel like the wand
erer who was unable to see the forest fo ][ r the ][  ][ trees. May the book bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive ][  
][ thought! ][  ][ December, 1916 ][  ][ A.  ][ EINSTEIN ][  ][ PART I ][  ][ THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ PHYSICAL M
EANING OF GEOMETRICAL PROPOSITIONS ][  ][ In you ][ r schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance ][  ][ with th
e noble building of Euclid's geometry, and you remem ][ ber -- ][  ][ perhaps with more respect than love -- the magnificent str
ucture, on ][  ][ the lofty staircase of which you were  ][ chased about for uncounted hours ][  ][ by conscientious teachers. B
y reason of our past experience, you would ][  ][ certainly  ][ regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the ][  ]
[ most out-of-the-way proposition of this science to be untrue.  ][ But ][  ][ perhaps this feeling of proud certainty would lea
ve you immediately if ][  ][ some one were to ask you: "What, then,  ][ do you mean by the assertion ][  ][ that these propositi
ons are true?" Let us proceed to give this ][  ][ question a little cons ][ ideration. ][  ][ Geometry sets out form certain con
ceptions such as "plane," "point," ][  ][ and "straight line," with which we ][  are able to associate more or less ][  ][ defin
ite ideas, and from certain simple propositions (axioms) which, ][  ][ in virtue ][  of these ideas, we are inclined to accept a
s "true." Then, ][  ][ on the basis of a logical process, the justification of which ][  we feel ][  ][ ourselves compelled to a
dmit, all remaining propositions are shown to ][  ][ follow from those axioms, i.e. they ][  are proven. A proposition is then ]
[  ][ correct ("true") when it has been derived in the recognised manner ][  ][ from the axi ][ oms. The question of "truth" of 
the individual geometrical ][  ][ propositions is thus reduced to one of the "truth" of the axio ][ ms. Now ][  ][ it has long b
een known that the last question is not only unanswerable ][  ][ by the methods of geometry, but tha ][ t it is in itself entire
ly without ][  ][ meaning. We cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line ][  ][ goes thro ][ ugh two points. We c
an only say that Euclidean geometry deals ][  ][ with things called "straight lines," to each of which is as ][ cribed the ][  ]
[ property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it. ][  ][ The concept "true" does not tally w ][ ith the asse
rtions of pure ][  ][ geometry, because by the word "true" we are eventually in the habit of ][  ][ designating alwa ][ ys the c
orrespondence with a "real" object; geometry, ][  ][ however, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved i ][ n ][
  ][ it to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of ][  ][ these ideas among themselves. ][  ][ It is  ][ 
not difficult to understand why, in spite of this, we feel ][  ][ constrained to call the propositions of geometry "true." Geome
 ][ trical ][  ][ ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature, and these ][  ][ last are undoubtedly the exclusive 
caus ][ e of the genesis of those ][  ][ ideas. Geometry ought to refrain from such a course, in order to give ][  ][ to its str
ucture t ][ he largest possible logical unity. The practice, for ][  ][ example, of seeing in a "distance" two marked positions 
on a ][  ][  ][ practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in our ][  ][ habit of thought. We are accustomed fur
ther to regard t ][ hree points as ][  ][ being situated on a straight line, if their apparent positions can be ][  ][ made to c
oincide for observat ][ ion with one eye, under suitable choice ][  ][ of our place of observation. ][  ][ If, in pursuance of o
ur habit of thought, we  ][ now supplement the ][  ][ propositions of Euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two ][  
][ points on a practically r ][ igid body always correspond to the same ][  ][ distance (line-interval), independently of any ch
anges in position to ][  ][ whic ][ h we may subject the body, the propositions of Euclidean geometry ][  ][ then resolve themse
lves into propositions on the possib ][ le relative ][  ][ position of practically rigid bodies.* Geometry which has been ][  ][
 supplemented in this way is then to be  ][ treated as a branch of physics. ][  ][ We can now legitimately ask as to the "truth"
 of geometrical ][  ][ propositions interpre ][ ted in this way, since we are justified in asking ][  ][ whether these propositi
ons are satisfied for those real things we have  ][ ][  ][ associated with the geometrical ideas. In less exact terms we can ][ 
 ][ express this by saying that by the "truth" of a  ][ geometrical ][  ][ proposition in this sense we understand its validity 
for a ][  ][ construction with rule and compasses. ][  ] ][ [ Of course the conviction of the "truth" of geometrical proposition
s in ][  ][ this sense is founded exclusively on rather inco ][ mplete experience. For ][  ][ the present we shall assume the "t
ruth" of the geometrical ][  ][ propositions, then at a later st ][ age (in the general theory of ][  ][ relativity) we shall se
e that this "truth" is limited, and we shall ][  ][ consider the ext ][ ent of its limitation. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) It follo
ws that a natural object is associated also with a ][  ][ straight line. ][  Three points A, B and C on a rigid body thus lie in
 a ][  ][ straight line when the points A and C being given, B is chosen suc ][ h ][  ][ that the sum of the distances AB and BC
 is as short as possible. This ][  ][ incomplete suggestion will suffice for the ][  present purpose. ][  ][ THE SYSTEM OF CO-OR
DINATES ][  ][ On the basis of the physical interpretation of distance which has bee ][ n ][  ][ indicated, we are also in a pos
ition to establish the distance between ][  ][ two points on a rigid body by means of me ][ asurements. For this purpose ][  ][ 
we require a " distance " (rod S) which is to be used once and for ][  ][ all, and which we  ][ employ as a standard measure. If
, now, A and B are ][  ][ two points on a rigid body, we can construct the line joining them ][  ][  ][ according to the rules o
f geometry ; then, starting from A, we can ][  ][ mark off the distance S time after time until we r ][ each B. The number ][  ]
[ of these operations required is the numerical measure of the distance ][  ][ AB. This is the basis of  ][ all measurement of l
ength. * ][  ][ Every description of the scene of an event or of the position of an ][  ][ object in space i ][ s based on the s
pecification of the point on a rigid ][  ][ body (body of reference) with which that event or object coincides.  ][ ][  ][ This 
applies not only to scientific description, but also to everyday ][  ][ life. If I analyse the place specification " ][  Times S
quare, New York," ][  ][ **A I arrive at the following result. The earth is the rigid body ][  ][ to which the specifica ][ tion
 of place refers; " Times Square, New York," ][  ][ is a well-defined point, to which a name has been assigned, and with ][  ][ 
 ][ which the event coincides in space.**B ][  ][ This primitive method of place specification deals only with places on ][  ][ 
 ][ the surface of rigid bodies, and is dependent on the existence of ][  ][ points on this surface which are distinguishable fr
om e ][ ach other. But ][  ][ we can free ourselves from both of these limitations without altering ][  ][ the nature of our spe
cificati ][ on of position. If, for instance, a cloud ][  ][ is hovering over Times Square, then we can determine its position ]
[  ][ relati ][ ve to the surface of the earth by erecting a pole ][  ][ perpendicularly on the Square, so that it reaches the c
loud. The ][  ][ ][  length of the pole measured with the standard measuring-rod, combined ][  ][ with the specification of the 
position of the foot ][  of the pole, ][  ][ supplies us with a complete place specification. On the basis of this ][  ][ illust
ration, we are able to s ][ ee the manner in which a refinement of ][  ][ the conception of position has been developed. ][  ][ 
(a) We imagine the rigid bod ][ y, to which the place specification is ][  ][ referred, supplemented in such a manner that the o
bject whose position ][  ][ we r ][ equire is reached by. the completed rigid body. ][  ][ (b) In locating the position of the o
bject, we make use of a number ][  ] ][ [ (here the length of the pole measured with the measuring-rod) instead ][  ][ of design
ated points of reference. ][  ][ (c) We  ][ speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole which ][  ][ reaches the cloud h
as not been erected. By means of optical ][  ][  ][ observations of the cloud from different positions on the ground, and ][  ][
 taking into account the properties of the propa ][ gation of light, we ][  ][ determine the length of the pole we should have r
equired in order to ][  ][ reach the cloud. ][  ][ F ][ rom this consideration we see that it will be advantageous if, in the ][
  ][ description of position, it should be possible by m ][ eans of numerical ][  ][ measures to make ourselves independent of t
he existence of marked ][  ][ positions (possessing names) o ][ n the rigid body of reference. In the ][  ][ physics of measurem
ent this is attained by the application of the ][  ][ Cartesian  ][ system of co-ordinates. ][  ][ This consists of three plane 
surfaces perpendicular to each other and ][  ][ rigidly attached to  ][ a rigid body. Referred to a system of ][  ][ co-ordinate
s, the scene of any event will be determined (for the main ][  ][ part)  ][ by the specification of the lengths of the three per
pendiculars ][  ][ or co-ordinates (x, y, z) which can be dropped from the s ][ cene of the ][  ][ event to those three plane su
rfaces. The lengths of these three ][  ][ perpendiculars can be determined by a  ][ series of manipulations with ][  ][ rigid me
asuring-rods performed according to the rules and methods laid ][  ][ down by Euclid ][ ean geometry. ][  ][ In practice, the ri
gid surfaces which constitute the system of ][  ][ co-ordinates are generally not availa ][ ble ; furthermore, the magnitudes ][
  ][ of the co-ordinates are not actually determined by constructions with ][  ][ rigid rods ][ , but by indirect means. If the 
results of physics and ][  ][ astronomy are to maintain their clearness, the physical meaning of ][  ][  ][ specifications of po
sition must always be sought in accordance with ][  ][ the above considerations. *** ][  ][ We thus  ][ obtain the following res
ult: Every description of events in ][  ][ space involves the use of a rigid body to which such events h ][ ave to be ][  ][ ref
erred. The resulting relationship takes for granted that the laws ][  ][ of Euclidean geometry hold for "dis ][ tances;" the "di
stance" being ][  ][ represented physically by means of the convention of two marks on a ][  ][ rigid body. ][   ][ ][   Notes ]
[  ][ * Here we have assumed that there is nothing left over i.e. that ][  ][ the measurement gives a whole number.  ][ This dif
ficulty is got over by ][  ][ the use of divided measuring-rods, the introduction of which does not ][  ][ demand any fu ][ ndam
entally new method. ][  ][ **A Einstein used "Potsdamer Platz, Berlin" in the original text. ][  ][ In the authorised transl ][ 
ation this was supplemented with "Tranfalgar ][  ][ Square, London". We have changed this to "Times Square, New York", as ][  ][
 ][  this is the most well known/identifiable location to English speakers ][  ][ in the present day. [Note by the janitor.] ][ 
 ][  ][ **B It is not necessary here to investigate further the significance ][  ][ of the expression "coincidence in space." Th
is conce ][ ption is ][  ][ sufficiently obvious to ensure that differences of opinion are ][  ][ scarcely likely to arise as to
 its applica ][ bility in practice. ][  ][ *** A refinement and modification of these views does not become ][  ][ necessary unt
il we come to de ][ al with the general theory of relativity, ][  ][ treated in the second part of this book. ][  ][ SPACE AND T
IME IN CLASSICAL MEC ][ HANICS ][  ][ The purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their ][  ][ position in space w
ith "time." I should loa ][ d my conscience with grave ][  ][ sins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were I to formulate the
 ][  ][ aims of mechanics in ][  this way, without serious reflection and detailed ][  ][ explanations. Let us proceed to disclo
se these sins. ][  ][ It is not  ][ clear what is to be understood here by "position" and ][  ][ "space." I stand at the window 
of a railway carriage which is ][  ] ][ [ travelling uniformly, and drop a stone on the embankment, without ][  ][ throwing it. 
Then, disregarding the influence of the  ][ air resistance, I ][  ][ see the stone descend in a straight line. A pedestrian who 
observes ][  ][ the misdeed from the footpat ][ h notices that the stone falls to earth in ][  ][ a parabolic curve. I now ask: 
Do the "positions" traversed by the ][  ][ stone ][  lie "in reality" on a straight line or on a parabola? Moreover, ][  ][ what
 is meant here by motion "in space" ? From the consi ][ derations of ][  ][ the previous section the answer is self-evident. In 
the first place we ][  ][ entirely shun the vague word " ][ space," of which, we must honestly ][  ][ acknowledge, we cannot for
m the slightest conception, and we replace ][  ][ it by "mot ][ ion relative to a practically rigid body of reference." The ][  
][ positions relative to the body of reference (railway carriage ][  or ][  ][ embankment) have already been defined in detail i
n the preceding ][  ][ section. If instead of " body of reference "  ][ we insert " system of ][  ][ co-ordinates," which is a u
seful idea for mathematical description, we ][  ][ are in a position to  ][ say : The stone traverses a straight line ][  ][ rel
ative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the carriage, ][  ][ b ][ ut relative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly 
attached to the ][  ][ ground (embankment) it describes a parabola. With the aid ][  of this ][  ][ example it is clearly seen t
hat there is no such thing as an ][  ][ independently existing trajectory (lit. "pat ][ h-curve"*), but only ][  ][ a trajectory
 relative to a particular body of reference. ][  ][ In order to have a complete descript ][ ion of the motion, we must specify ]
[  ][ how the body alters its position with time ; i.e. for every point on ][  ][ the trajec ][ tory it must be stated at what t
ime the body is situated ][  ][ there. These data must be supplemented by such a definition of t ][ ime ][  ][ that, in virtue o
f this definition, these time-values can be regarded ][  ][ essentially as magnitudes (results of me ][ asurements) capable of ]
[  ][ observation. If we take our stand on the ground of classical ][  ][ mechanics, we can satisfy this ][  requirement for our
 illustration in the ][  ][ following manner. We imagine two clocks of identical construction ; ][  ][ the m ][ an at the railwa
y-carriage window is holding one of them, and the ][  ][ man on the footpath the other. Each of the observers de ][ termines the
 ][  ][ position on his own reference-body occupied by the stone at each tick ][  ][ of the clock he is holding in h ][ is hand.
 In this connection we have not ][  ][ taken account of the inaccuracy involved by the finiteness of the ][  ][ velocity ][  of 
propagation of light. With this and with a second ][  ][ difficulty prevailing here we shall have to deal in detail later. ] ][ 
[  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) That is, a curve along which the body moves. ][  ][ THE GALILEIAN SYSTEM OF CO-ORDINATES ][  ][ As is we
 ][ ll known, the fundamental law of the mechanics of ][  ][ Galilei-Newton, which is known as the law of inertia, can be stated
 ][  ][  ][ thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a ][  ][ state of rest or of uniform motion in 
a straig ][ ht line. This law not ][  ][ only says something about the motion of the bodies, but it also ][  ][ indicates the re
ference-bodi ][ es or systems of coordinates, permissible ][  ][ in mechanics, which can be used in mechanical description. The 
visible ][  ][ f ][ ixed stars are bodies for which the law of inertia certainly holds to ][  ][ a high degree of approximation.
 Now if we use a sys ][ tem of co-ordinates ][  ][ which is rigidly attached to the earth, then, relative to this system, ][  ][
 every fixed star descri ][ bes a circle of immense radius in the course of ][  ][ an astronomical day, a result which is oppose
d to the statement of the ][ ][   ][ law of inertia. So that if we adhere to this law we must refer these ][  ][ motions only to
 systems of coordinates relative ][  to which the fixed ][  ][ stars do not move in a circle. A system of co-ordinates of which 
the ][  ][ state of motion is such t ][ hat the law of inertia holds relative to it ][  ][ is called a " Galileian system of co-
ordinates." The laws of the ][  ][ mecha ][ nics of Galflei-Newton can be regarded as valid only for a ][  ][ Galileian system o
f co-ordinates. ][  ][ THE PRINCIPLE OF RELA ][ TIVITY ][  ][ (IN THE RESTRICTED SENSE) ][  ][ In order to attain the greatest p
ossible clearness, let us return to ][  ][ our e ][ xample of the railway carriage supposed to be travelling ][  ][ uniformly. W
e call its motion a uniform translation ("uniform" b ][ ecause ][  ][ it is of constant velocity and direction, " translation " 
because ][  ][ although the carriage changes its positio ][ n relative to the embankment ][  ][ yet it does not rotate in so doi
ng). Let us imagine a raven flying ][  ][ through the air in ][  such a manner that its motion, as observed from the ][  ][ emba
nkment, is uniform and in a straight line. If we were to observe ][  ][  ][ the flying raven from the moving railway carriage. w
e should find that ][  ][ the motion of the raven would be one of di ][ fferent velocity and ][  ][ direction, but that it would
 still be uniform and in a straight line. ][  ][ Expressed in an abstrac ][ t manner we may say : If a mass m is moving ][  ][ u
niformly in a straight line with respect to a co-ordinate system K, ][  ][ t ][ hen it will also be moving uniformly and in a st
raight line relative ][  ][ to a second co-ordinate system K1 provided that the  ][ latter is ][  ][ executing a uniform transla
tory motion with respect to K. In ][  ][ accordance with the discussion contained in ][  the preceding section, it ][  ][ follow
s that: ][  ][ If K is a Galileian co-ordinate system. then every other co-ordinate ][   ][ ][ system K' is a Galileian one, whe
n, in relation to K, it is in a ][  ][ condition of uniform motion of translation. Relative  ][ to K1 the ][  ][ mechanical laws
 of Galilei-Newton hold good exactly as they do with ][  ][ respect to K. ][  ][ We advance a st ][ ep farther in our generalisa
tion when we express the ][  ][ tenet thus: If, relative to K, K1 is a uniformly moving co-ordinate  ][ ][  ][ system devoid of 
rotation, then natural phenomena run their course ][  ][ with respect to K1 according to exactly the sam ][ e general laws as wi
th ][  ][ respect to K. This statement is called the principle of relativity (in ][  ][ the restricted sense ][ ). ][  ][ As lon
g as one was convinced that all natural phenomena were capable ][  ][ of representation with the help of classic ][ al mechanics
, there was no ][  ][ need to doubt the validity of this principle of relativity. But in ][  ][ view of the more rec ][ ent deve
lopment of electrodynamics and optics it ][  ][ became more and more evident that classical mechanics affords an ][  ][  ][ insu
fficient foundation for the physical description of all natural ][  ][ phenomena. At this juncture the question of the valid ][ 
ity of the ][  ][ principle of relativity became ripe for discussion, and it did not ][  ][ appear impossible that the answer to
 ][  this question might be in the ][  ][ negative. ][  ][ Nevertheless, there are two general facts which at the outset speak ]
[  ] ][ [ very much in favour of the validity of the principle of relativity. ][  ][ Even though classical mechanics does not su
pply us  ][ with a sufficiently ][  ][ broad basis for the theoretical presentation of all physical ][  ][ phenomena, still we m
ust grant it ][  a considerable measure of " truth," ][  ][ since it supplies us with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies 
][  ][ with a de ][ licacy of detail little short of wonderful. The principle of ][  ][ relativity must therefore apply with gre
at accuracy in the d ][ omain of ][  ][ mechanics. But that a principle of such broad generality should hold ][  ][ with such ex
actness in one domain of ][  phenomena, and yet should be ][  ][ invalid for another, is a priori not very probable. ][  ][ We n
ow proceed to the second arg ][ ument, to which, moreover, we shall ][  ][ return later. If the principle of relativity (in the 
restricted sense) ][  ][ does no ][ t hold, then the Galileian co-ordinate systems K, K1, K2, etc., ][  ][ which are moving unif
ormly relative to each other, will n ][ ot be ][  ][ equivalent for the description of natural phenomena. In this case we ][  ][
 should be constrained to believe that n ][ atural laws are capable of ][  ][ being formulated in a particularly simple manner, 
and of course only ][  ][ on condition that, ][  from amongst all possible Galileian co-ordinate ][  ][ systems, we should have 
chosen one (K[0]) of a particular state of ][  ] ][ [ motion as our body of reference. We should then be justified (because ][  
][ of its merits for the description of natural phen ][ omena) in calling ][  ][ this system " absolutely at rest," and all othe
r Galileian systems K " ][  ][ in motion." If, for insta ][ nce, our embankment were the system K[0] then ][  ][ our railway car
riage would be a system K, relative to which less ][  ][ sim ][ ple laws would hold than with respect to K[0]. This diminished ]
[  ][ simplicity would be due to the fact that the carriage K wo ][ uld be in ][  ][ motion (i.e."really")with respect to K[0]. 
In the general laws of ][  ][ nature which have been formulated with ][  reference to K, the magnitude ][  ][ and direction of t
he velocity of the carriage would necessarily play a ][  ][ part. We sho ][ uld expect, for instance, that the note emitted by a
n ][  ][ organpipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of travel  ][ ][  ][ would be different from that emitted if t
he axis of the pipe were ][  ][ placed perpendicular to this direction. ][  ][ N ][ ow in virtue of its motion in an orbit round
 the sun, our earth is ][  ][ comparable with a railway carriage travelling with a v ][ elocity of about ][  ][ 30 kilometres pe
r second. If the principle of relativity were not ][  ][ valid we should therefore expec ][ t that the direction of motion of th
e ][  ][ earth at any moment would enter into the laws of nature, and also that ][  ][ physi ][ cal systems in their behaviour w
ould be dependent on the ][  ][ orientation in space with respect to the earth. For owing to the ][  ][  ][ alteration in direct
ion of the velocity of revolution of the earth in ][  ][ the course of a year, the earth cannot be a ][ t rest relative to the ]
[  ][ hypothetical system K[0] throughout the whole year. However, the most ][  ][ careful observations  ][ have never revealed 
such anisotropic properties ][  ][ in terrestrial physical space, i.e. a physical non-equivalence of ][  ][  ][ different direct
ions. This is very powerful argument in favour of the ][  ][ principle of relativity. ][  ][ THE THEOREM OF THE  ][ ][  ][ ADDIT
ION OF VELOCITIES ][  ][ EMPLOYED IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS ][  ][ Let us suppose our old friend the railway carriage t ][ o be tra
velling ][  ][ along the rails with a constant velocity v, and that a man traverses ][  ][ the length of the carriage in ][  the
 direction of travel with a velocity ][  ][ w. How quickly or, in other words, with what velocity W does the man ][  ][ adva ][ 
nce relative to the embankment during the process ? The only ][  ][ possible answer seems to result from the following considera
 ][ tion: If ][  ][ the man were to stand still for a second, he would advance relative to ][  ][ the embankment through a dista
nce  ][ v equal numerically to the velocity ][  ][ of the carriage. As a consequence of his walking, however, he ][  ][ traverse
s an add ][ itional distance w relative to the carriage, and hence ][  ][ also relative to the embankment, in this second, the d
istance w be ][ ing ][  ][ numerically equal to the velocity with which he is walking. Thus in ][  ][ total be covers the distan
ce W=v+w relativ ][ e to the embankment in the ][  ][ second considered. We shall see later that this result, which ][  ][ expre
sses the theorem of  ][ the addition of velocities employed in ][  ][ classical mechanics, cannot be maintained ; in other words
, the law ][  ][ that we ][  have just written down does not hold in reality. For the time ][  ][ being, however, we shall assum
e its correctness. ][  ][ TH ][ E APPARENT INCOMPATIBILITY OF THE ][  ][ LAW OF PROPAGATION OF LIGHT WITH THE ][  ][ PRINCIPLE O
F RELATIVITY ][  ][ There is har ][ dly a simpler law in physics than that according to which ][  ][ light is propagated in empt
y space. Every child at school knows ][ , or ][  ][ believes he knows, that this propagation takes place in straight lines ][  ]
[ with a velocity c= 300,000 km./sec. At ][  all events we know with great ][  ][ exactness that this velocity is the same for a
ll colours, because if ][  ][ this were not  ][ the case, the minimum of emission would not be observed ][  ][ simultaneously fo
r different colours during the eclipse of a fixe ][ d ][  ][ star by its dark neighbour. By means of similar considerations base
d ][  ][ on observa- tions of double stars, the Dutc ][ h astronomer De Sitter was ][  ][ also able to show that the velocity of
 propagation of light cannot ][  ][ depend on the veloci ][ ty of motion of the body emitting the light. The ][  ][ assumption t
hat this velocity of propagation is dependent on the ][  ][  ][ direction "in space" is in itself improbable. ][  ][ In short, l
et us assume that the simple law of the constancy of the ][  ][  ][ velocity of light c (in vacuum) is justifiably believed by t
he child ][  ][ at school. Who would imagine that this simple law ha ][ s plunged the ][  ][ conscientiously thoughtful physicis
t into the greatest intellectual ][  ][ difficulties? Let us consider ho ][ w these difficulties arise. ][  ][ Of course we must
 refer the process of the propagation of light (and ][  ][ indeed every othe ][ r process) to a rigid reference-body (co-ordinat
e ][  ][ system). As such a system let us again choose our embankment. We shall  ][ ][  ][ imagine the air above it to have been
 removed. If a ray of light be ][  ][ sent along the embankment, we see from the abo ][ ve that the tip of the ][  ][ ray will b
e transmitted with the velocity c relative to the ][  ][ embankment. Now let us suppose  ][ that our railway carriage is again ]
[  ][ travelling along the railway lines with the velocity v, and that its ][  ][ direction  ][ is the same as that of the ray o
f light, but its velocity of ][  ][ course much less. Let us inquire about the velocity of propa ][ gation of ][  ][ the ray of 
light relative to the carriage. It is obvious that we can ][  ][ here apply the consideration of the ][  previous section, since
 the ray of ][  ][ light plays the part of the man walking along relatively to the ][  ][ carriage. The  ][ velocity w of the ma
n relative to the embankment is here ][  ][ replaced by the velocity of light relative to the embankment. w  ][ is the ][  ][ re
quired velocity of light with respect to the carriage, and we have ][  ][                                w = c-v ][ . ][  ][ The
 velocity of propagation ot a ray of light relative to the carriage ][  ][ thus comes cut smaller than c. ][  ][ But ][  this re
sult comes into conflict with the principle of relativity ][  ][ set forth in Section V. For, like every other general l ][ aw o
f ][  ][ nature, the law of the transmission of light in vacuo [in vacuum] ][  ][ must, according to the principle of relati ][ 
vity, be the same for the ][  ][ railway carriage as reference-body as when the rails are the body of ][  ][ reference. But, fro
 ][ m our above consideration, this would appear to be ][  ][ impossible. If every ray of light is propagated relative to the ][
  ][ ][  embankment with the velocity c, then for this reason it would appear ][  ][ that another law of propagation of light mu
st neces ][ sarily hold with ][  ][ respect to the carriage -- a result contradictory to the principle of ][  ][ relativity. ][ 
 ][ In view  ][ of this dilemma there appears to be nothing else for it than ][  ][ to abandon either the principle of relativit
y or the simple  ][ law of the ][  ][ propagation of light in vacuo. Those of you who have carefully ][  ][ followed the precedi
ng discussion are al ][ most sure to expect that we ][  ][ should retain the principle of relativity, which appeals so ][  ][ co
nvincingly to the intell ][ ect because it is so natural and simple. The ][  ][ law of the propagation of light in vacuo would t
hen have to be ][  ][ replac ][ ed by a more complicated law conformable to the principle of ][  ][ relativity. The development 
of theoretical physics shows, ho ][ wever, ][  ][ that we cannot pursue this course. The epoch-making theoretical ][  ][ investi
gations of H. A. Lorentz on the elec ][ trodynamical and optical ][  ][ phenomena connected with moving bodies show that experie
nce in this ][  ][ domain leads conclusi ][ vely to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena, of ][  ][ which the law of the consta
ncy of the velocity of light in vacuo is a ] ][ [  ][ necessary consequence. Prominent theoretical physicists were theref ][  ][
 ore more inclined to reject the principle of re ][ lativity, in spite of ][  ][ the fact that no empirical data had been found 
which were ][  ][ contradictory to this principle. ] ][ [  ][ At this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena. As a 
][  ][ result of an analysis of the physical conceptions ][  of time and space, ][  ][ it became evident that in realily there i
s not the least ][  ][ incompatibilitiy between the principl ][ e of relativity and the law of ][  ][ propagation of light, and 
that by systematically holding fast to both ][  ][ these laws a  ][ logically rigid theory could be arrived at. This theory ][  
][ has been called the special theory of relativity to distinguish i ][ t ][  ][ from the extended theory, with which we shall d
eal later. In the ][  ][ following pages we shall present the fundamenta ][ l ideas of the special ][  ][ theory of relativity. 
][  ][ ON THE IDEA OF TIME IN PHYSICS ][  ][ Lightning has struck the rails  ][ on our railway embankment at two places ][  ][ A
 and B far distant from each other. I make the additional assertion ][  ][ that  ][ these two lightning flashes occurred simulta
neously. If I ask you ][  ][ whether there is sense in this statement, you will answ ][ er my question ][  ][ with a decided "Ye
s." But if I now approach you with the request to ][  ][ explain to me the sense of the  ][ statement more precisely, you find ]
[  ][ after some consideration that the answer to this question is not so ][  ][ easy as it  ][ appears at first sight. ][  ][ A
fter some time perhaps the following answer would occur to you: "The ][  ][ significance of the  ][ statement is clear in itself
 and needs no further ][  ][ explanation; of course it would require some consideration if I were ][ ][   ][ to be commissioned 
to determine by observations whether in the actual ][  ][ case the two events took place simultaneously  ][ or not." I cannot be
 ][  ][ satisfied with this answer for the following reason. Supposing that as ][  ][ a result of ingenious  ][ considerations a
n able meteorologist were to ][  ][ discover that the lightning must always strike the places A and B ][  ][ sim ][ ultaneously,
 then we should be faced with the task of testing ][  ][ whether or not this theoretical result is in accordance wit ][ h the ][
  ][ reality. We encounter the same difficulty with all physical statements ][  ][ in which the conception " simultaneou ][ s " 
plays a part. The concept ][  ][ does not exist for the physicist until he has the possibility of ][  ][ discovering whether ][ 
 or not it is fulfilled in an actual case. We thus ][  ][ require a definition of simultaneity such that this definition ][  ][ 
 ][ supplies us with the method by means of which, in the present case, he ][  ][ can decide by experiment whether or not both t
he l ][ ightning strokes ][  ][ occurred simultaneously. As long as this requirement is not satisfied, ][  ][ I allow myself to 
be decei ][ ved as a physicist (and of course the same ][  ][ applies if I am not a physicist), when I imagine that I am able to
 ][  ][ atta ][ ch a meaning to the statement of simultaneity. (I would ask the ][  ][ reader not to proceed farther until he is
 fully convinced ][  on this ][  ][ point.) ][  ][ After thinking the matter over for some time you then offer the ][  ][ follow
ing suggestion with  ][ which to test simultaneity. By measuring ][  ][ along the rails, the connecting line AB should be measur
ed up and an ][  ][ obse ][ rver placed at the mid-point M of the distance AB. This observer ][  ][ should be supplied with an a
rrangement (e.g. two mirrors ][  inclined at ][  ][ 90^0) which allows him visually to observe both places A and B at the ][  ][
 same time. If the observer perc ][ eives the two flashes of lightning at ][  ][ the same time, then they are simultaneous. ][  
][ I am very pleased with this sugge ][ stion, but for all that I cannot ][  ][ regard the matter as quite settled, because I fe
el constrained to ][  ][ raise the follo ][ wing objection: ][  ][ "Your definition would certainly be right, if only I knew tha
t the ][  ][ light by means of which the obs ][ erver at M perceives the lightning ][  ][ flashes travels along the length A arr
ow M with the same velocity as ][  ][ along the  ][ length B arrow M. But an examination of this supposition ][  ][ would only b
e possible if we already had at our disposal the mea ][ ns of ][  ][ measuring time. It would thus appear as though we were movi
ng here in ][  ][ a logical circle." ][  ][ After furthe ][ r consideration you cast a somewhat disdainful glance at ][  ][ me -
- and rightly so -- and you declare: ][  ][ "I maintain my p ][ revious definition nevertheless, because in reality it ][  ][ as
sumes absolutely nothing about light. There is only one demand t ][ o be ][  ][ made of the definition of simultaneity, namely, 
that in every real ][  ][ case it must supply us with an empirical d ][ ecision as to whether or not ][  ][ the conception that 
has to be defined is fulfilled. That my definition ][  ][ satisfies this ][  demand is indisputable. That light requires the sam
e ][  ][ time to traverse the path A arrow M as for the path B arrow M is in ][  ][  ][ reality neither a supposition nor a hypo
thesis about the physical ][  ][ nature of light, but a stipulation which I can  ][ make of my own freewill ][  ][ in order to a
rrive at a definition of simultaneity." ][  ][ It is clear that this definition can  ][ be used to give an exact meaning ][  ][ 
not only to two events, but to as many events as we care to choose, ][  ][ and independe ][ ntly of the positions of the scenes 
of the events with ][  ][ respect to the body of reference * (here the railway embankment).  ][ ][  ][ We are thus led also to a
 definition of " time " in physics. For this ][  ][ purpose we suppose that clocks of identical  ][ construction are placed at ]
[  ][ the points A, B and C of the railway line (co-ordinate system) and ][  ][ that they are set in ][  such a manner that the 
positions of their ][  ][ pointers are simultaneously (in the above sense) the same. Under these ][  ][  ][ conditions we unders
tand by the " time " of an event the reading ][  ][ (position of the hands) of that one of these clocks whic ][ h is in the ][  
][ immediate vicinity (in space) of the event. In this manner a ][  ][ time-value is associated with every event ][  which is es
sentially capable ][  ][ of observation. ][  ][ This stipulation contains a further physical hypothesis, the validit ][ y ][  ][
 of which will hardly be doubted without empirical evidence to the ][  ][ contrary. It has been assumed that all these c ][ lock
s go at the same ][  ][ rate if they are of identical construction. Stated more exactly: When ][  ][ two clocks arranged at  ][ 
rest in different places of a reference-body ][  ][ are set in such a manner that a particular position of the pointers of ][  ]
 ][ [ the one clock is simultaneous (in the above sense) with the same ][  ][ position, of the pointers of the other clock, then
 ide ][ ntical " ][  ][ settings " are always simultaneous (in the sense of the above ][  ][ definition). ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ 
*) We su ][ ppose further, that, when three events A, B and C occur in ][  ][ different places in such a manner that A is simult
aneous with  ][ B and B ][  ][ is simultaneous with C (simultaneous in the sense of the above ][  ][ definition), then the crite
rion for the sim ][ ultaneity of the pair of ][  ][ events A, C is also satisfied. This assumption is a physical ][  ][ hypothes
is about the the of  ][ propagation of light: it must certainly be ][  ][ fulfilled if we are to maintain the law of the constan
cy of the ][  ][ velocit ][ y of light in vacuo. ][  ][ THE RELATIVITY OF SIMULATNEITY ][  ][ Up to now our considerations have 
been referred to a particula ][ r body ][  ][ of reference, which we have styled a " railway embankment." We suppose ][  ][ a ve
ry long train travelling along t ][ he rails with the constant ][  ][ velocity v and in the direction indicated in Fig 1. People
 travelling ][  ][ in this train wil ][ l with a vantage view the train as a rigid ][  ][ reference-body (co-ordinate system); t
hey regard all events in ][  ][          ][                Fig. 01: file fig01.gif ][  ][ reference to the train. Then every eve
nt which takes place along the ][  ][ line a ][ lso takes place at a particular point of the train. Also the ][  ][ definition o
f simultaneity can be given relative to the trai ][ n in ][  ][ exactly the same way as with respect to the embankment. As a nat
ural ][  ][ consequence, however, the following ques ][ tion arises : ][  ][ Are two events (e.g. the two strokes of lightning A
 and B) which are ][  ][ simultaneous with reference to  ][ the railway embankment also ][  ][ simultaneous relatively to the tr
ain? We shall show directly that the ][  ][ answer must be i ][ n the negative. ][  ][ When we say that the lightning strokes A 
and B are simultaneous with ][  ][ respect to be embankment, we  ][ mean: the rays of light emitted at the ][  ][ places A and B
, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at the ][  ][ mid-poin ][ t M of the length A arrow B of the embankment. But the e
vents ][  ][ A and B also correspond to positions A and B on the train.  ][ Let M1 be ][  ][ the mid-point of the distance A arr
ow B on the travelling train. Just ][  ][ when the flashes (as judged from t ][ he embankment) of lightning occur, ][  ][ this p
oint M1 naturally coincides with the point M but it moves ][  ][ towards the rig ][ ht in the diagram with the velocity v of the
 train. If ][  ][ an observer sitting in the position M1 in the train did not posses ][ s ][  ][ this velocity, then he would re
main permanently at M, and the light ][  ][ rays emitted by the flashes of lightning A a ][ nd B would reach him ][  ][ simultan
eously, i.e. they would meet just where he is situated. Now in ][  ][ reality (considered wi ][ th reference to the railway emba
nkment) he is ][  ][ hastening towards the beam of light coming from B, whilst he is riding ][   ][ ][ on ahead of the beam of l
ight coming from A. Hence the observer will ][  ][ see the beam of light emitted from B earlier than ][  he will see that ][  ][
 emitted from A. Observers who take the railway train as their ][  ][ reference-body must therefore come ][  to the conclusion t
hat the ][  ][ lightning flash B took place earlier than the lightning flash A. We ][  ][ thus arrive at the ][  important resul
t: ][  ][ Events which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not ][  ][ simultaneous with respec ][ t to the tra
in, and vice versa (relativity of ][  ][ simultaneity). Every reference-body (co-ordinate system) has its own ][  ][ ][  particu
lar time ; unless we are told the reference-body to which the ][  ][ statement of time refers, there is no meaning in a  ][ stat
ement of the ][  ][ time of an event. ][  ][ Now before the advent of the theory of relativity it had always ][  ][ tacitly  ][ 
been assumed in physics that the statement of time had an ][  ][ absolute significance, i.e. that it is independent of the state
 ][  of ][  ][ motion of the body of reference. But we have just seen that this ][  ][ assumption is incompatible with the most 
natu ][ ral definition of ][  ][ simultaneity; if we discard this assumption, then the conflict between ][  ][ the law of the pr
opagatio ][ n of light in vacuo and the principle of ][  ][ relativity (developed in Section 7) disappears. ][  ][ We were led t
o that confl ][ ict by the considerations of Section 6, ][  ][ which are now no longer tenable. In that section we concluded tha
t the ][  ][ man ][  in the carriage, who traverses the distance w per second relative ][  ][ to the carriage, traverses the sam
e distance also with ][  respect to the ][  ][ embankment in each second of time. But, according to the foregoing ][  ][ conside
rations, the time requir ][ ed by a particular occurrence with ][  ][ respect to the carriage must not be considered equal to th
e duration ][  ][ of the sam ][ e occurrence as judged from the embankment (as ][  ][ reference-body). Hence it cannot be conten
ded that the man in walking ][   ][ ][ travels the distance w relative to the railway line in a time which is ][  ][ equal to on
e second as judged from the embankme ][ nt. ][  ][ Moreover, the considerations of Section 6 are based on yet a second ][  ][ as
sumption, which, in the light of a stric ][ t consideration, appears to ][  ][ be arbitrary, although it was always tacitly made
 even before the ][  ][ introduction of the  ][ theory of relativity. ][  ][ ON THE RELATIVITY OF THE CONCEPTION OF DISTANCE ][ 
 ][ Let us consider two particular points on the ][  train * travelling ][  ][ along the embankment with the velocity v, and inq
uire as to their ][  ][ distance apart. We already k ][ now that it is necessary to have a body of ][  ][ reference for the meas
urement of a distance, with respect to which ][  ][ body ][  the distance can be measured up. It is the simplest plan to use ][ 
 ][ the train itself as reference-body (co-ordinate system). ][  An observer ][  ][ in the train measures the interval by markin
g off his measuring-rod in ][  ][ a straight line (e.g. along th ][ e floor of the carriage) as many times ][  ][ as is necessar
y to take him from the one marked point to the other. ][  ][ Then th ][ e number which tells us how often the rod has to be laid
 down ][  ][ is the required distance. ][  ][ It is a different matter w ][ hen the distance has to be judged from the ][  ][ ra
ilway line. Here the following method suggests itself. If we call ][  ][ A^1 ][  and B^1 the two points on the train whose dista
nce apart is ][  ][ required, then both of these points are moving with the velo ][ city v ][  ][ along the embankment. In the f
irst place we require to determine the ][  ][ points A and B of the embankment which ][  are just being passed by the ][  ][ two
 points A^1 and B^1 at a particular time t -- judged from the ][  ][ embankment. These p ][ oints A and B of the embankment can 
be determined ][  ][ by applying the definition of time given in Section 8. The distance ][  ][  ][ between these points A and B
 is then measured by repeated application ][  ][ of thee measuring-rod along the embankment. ][  ][  ][ A priori it is by no mea
ns certain that this last measurement will ][  ][ supply us with the same result as the first. Thus  ][ the length of the ][  ][
 train as measured from the embankment may be different from that ][  ][ obtained by measuring in the tr ][ ain itself. This cir
cumstance leads us ][  ][ to a second objection which must be raised against the apparently ][  ][ obvious c ][ onsideration of 
Section 6. Namely, if the man in the ][  ][ carriage covers the distance w in a unit of time -- measured from th ][ e ][  ][ tra
in, -- then this distance -- as measured from the embankment -- is ][  ][ not necessarily also equal to w. ][  ][    ][ Notes ][
  ][ *) e.g. the middle of the first and of the hundredth carriage. ][  ][ THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION ][  ][ The results ][  of 
the last three sections show that the apparent ][  ][ incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle  ][ 
][  ][ of relativity (Section 7) has been derived by means of a ][  ][ consideration which borrowed two unjustifiable hypotheses
 ][  from ][  ][ classical mechanics; these are as follows: ][  ][ (1) The time-interval (time) between two events is independen
t of ][  the ][  ][ condition of motion of the body of reference. ][  ][ (2) The space-interval (distance) between two points of
 a rigid ][  body ][  ][ is independent of the condition of motion of the body of reference. ][  ][ If we drop these hypotheses,
 then the di ][ lemma of Section 7 ][  ][ disappears, because the theorem of the addition of velocities derived ][  ][ in Sectio
n 6 becomes inva ][ lid. The possibility presents itself that ][  ][ the law of the propagation of light in vacuo may be compati
ble with ][  ][ the  ][ principle of relativity, and the question arises: How have we to ][  ][ modify the considerations of Sec
tion 6 in order to remov ][ e the ][  ][ apparent disagreement between these two fundamental results of ][  ][ experience? This 
question leads to a general  ][ one. In the discussion of ][  ][ Section 6 we have to do with places and times relative both to 
the ][  ][ train and to the emba ][ nkment. How are we to find the place and time of ][  ][ an event in relation to the train, w
hen we know the place and time of ][ ][   ][ the event with respect to the railway embankment ? Is there a ][  ][ thinkable answ
er to this question of such a nature tha ][ t the law of ][  ][ transmission of light in vacuo does not contradict the principle
 of ][  ][ relativity ? In other words : Can ][  we conceive of a relation between ][  ][ place and time of the individual event
s relative to both ][  ][ reference-bodies, such ][  that every ray of light possesses the velocity ][  ][ of transmission c rel
ative to the embankment and relative to the train ][ ][   ][ ? This question leads to a quite definite positive answer, and to a
 ][  ][ perfectly definite transformation law for the sp ][ ace-time magnitudes of ][  ][ an event when changing over from one b
ody of reference to another. ][  ][ Before we deal with this ][ , we shall introduce the following incidental ][  ][ considerati
on. Up to the present we have only considered events taking ][   ][ ][ place along the embankment, which had mathematically to a
ssume the ][  ][ function of a straight line. In the manner indicate ][ d in Section 2 ][  ][ we can imagine this reference-body
 supplemented laterally and in a ][  ][ vertical direction by means of a ][  framework of rods, so that an event ][  ][ which ta
kes place anywhere can be localised with reference to this ][  ][ framework. ][  Fig. 2 Similarly, we can imagine the train trav
elling with ][  ][ the velocity v to be continued across the whole of space, so  ][ that ][  ][ every event, no matter how far o
ff it may be, could also be localised ][  ][ with respect to the second framework. W ][ ithout committing any ][  ][ fundamental
 error, we can disregard the fact that in reality these ][  ][ frameworks would continua ][ lly interfere with each other, owing
 to the ][  ][ impenetrability of solid bodies. In every such framework we imagine ][  ][ th ][ ree surfaces perpendicular to ea
ch other marked out, and designated ][  ][ as " co-ordinate planes " (" co-ordinate system "). A ][  co-ordinate ][  ][ system K
 then corresponds to the embankment, and a co-ordinate system ][  ][ K' to the train. An event, wher ][ ever it may have taken p
lace, would be ][  ][ fixed in space with respect to K by the three perpendiculars x, y, z ][  ][ on the ][  co-ordinate planes,
 and with regard to time by a time value t. ][  ][ Relative to K1, the same event would be fixed in respect  ][ of space and ][ 
 ][ time by corresponding values x1, y1, z1, t1, which of course are not ][  ][ identical with x, y, z, t. It ha ][ s already be
en set forth in detail how ][  ][ these magnitudes are to be regarded as results of physical ][  ][ measurements. ][ ][   ][ Obv
iously our problem can be exactly formulated in the following ][  ][ manner. What are the values x1, y1, z1, t1, of an e ][ vent
 with respect ][  ][ to K1, when the magnitudes x, y, z, t, of the same event with respect ][  ][ to K are given ? The relat ][ 
ions must be so chosen that the law of the ][  ][ transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied for one and the same ray ][  ][ of
 ][  light (and of course for every ray) with respect to K and K1. For ][  ][ the relative orientation in space of the co-ordina
te s ][ ystems indicated ][  ][ in the diagram ([7]Fig. 2), this problem is solved by means of the ][  ][ equations : ][  ][    
         ][               eq. 1: file eq01.gif ][  ][                                 y1 = y ][  ][                             
    z1 = z ] ][ [  ][                          eq. 2: file eq02.gif ][  ][ This system of equations is known as the " Lorentz tr
ansformation." * ][  ][  ][ If in place of the law of transmission of light we had taken as our ][  ][ basis the tacit assumptio
ns of the older mech ][ anics as to the absolute ][  ][ character of times and lengths, then instead of the above we should ][  
][ have obtained the fol ][ lowing equations: ][  ][                              x1 = x - vt ][  ][                            
     y1 = y ][  ][           ][                        z1 = z ][  ][                                 t1 = t ][  ][ This system o
f equations is often termed the  ][ " Galilei ][  ][ transformation." The Galilei transformation can be obtained from the ][  ][
 Lorentz transformation by substitut ][ ing an infinitely large value for ][  ][ the velocity of light c in the latter transform
ation. ][  ][ Aided by the following ill ][ ustration, we can readily see that, in ][  ][ accordance with the Lorentz transforma
tion, the law of the ][  ][ transmission of  ][ light in vacuo is satisfied both for the ][  ][ reference-body K and for the ref
erence-body K1. A light-signal is sent ][  ][ al ][ ong the positive x-axis, and this light-stimulus advances in ][  ][ accordan
ce with the equation ][  ][                          ][        x = ct, ][  ][ i.e. with the velocity c. According to the equatio
ns of the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation, this simple rel ][ ation between x and t involves a ][  ][ relation between x1 and t1. 
In point of fact, if we substitute for x ][  ][ the value ct ][  in the first and fourth equations of the Lorentz ][  ][ transfo
rmation, we obtain: ][  ][                          eq. 3: file  ][ eq03.gif ][  ][                          eq. 4: file eq04.gi
f ][  ][ from which, by division, the expression ][  ][              ][                    x1 = ct1 ][  ][ immediately follows. 
If referred to the system K1, the propagation of ][  ][ light takes plac ][ e according to this equation. We thus see that the ]
[  ][ velocity of transmission relative to the reference-body K1 is also ][  ][  ][ equal to c. The same result is obtained for 
rays of light advancing in ][  ][ any other direction whatsoever. Of cause this  ][ is not surprising, since ][  ][ the equation
s of the Lorentz transformation were derived conformably ][  ][ to this point of vie ][ w. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) A simple der
ivation of the Lorentz transformation is given in ][  ][ Appendix I. ][  ][ THE BEHAVIOU ][ R OF MEASURING-RODS AND CLOCKS IN MO
TION ][  ][ Place a metre-rod in the x1-axis of K1 in such a manner that one end ][  ][ (the ][  beginning) coincides with the p
oint x1=0 whilst the other end ][  ][ (the end of the rod) coincides with the point x1=I. What i ][ s the length ][  ][ of the m
etre-rod relatively to the system K? In order to learn this, ][  ][ we need only ask where the begin ][ ning of the rod and the 
end of the rod ][  ][ lie with respect to K at a particular time t of the system K. By means ][  ][ of t ][ he first equation of
 the Lorentz transformation the values of ][  ][ these two points at the time t = 0 can be shown to be ][  ] ][ [               
         eq. 05a: file eq05a.gif ][  ][                        eq. 05b: file eq05b.gif ][  ][ the distance betwe ][ en the point
s being eq. 06 . ][  ][ But the metre-rod is moving with the velocity v relative to K. It ][  ][ therefore follows t ][ hat the 
length of a rigid metre-rod moving in the ][  ][ direction of its length with a velocity v is eq. 06 of a metre. ][  ][  ][ The 
rigid rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at rest, and ][  ][ the more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod ][ 
. For the ][  ][ velocity v=c we should have eq. 06a , ][  ][ and for stiII greater velocities the square-root becomes imaginary
 ][ . ][  ][ From this we conclude that in the theory of relativity the velocity c ][  ][ plays the part of a limiting velocity,
 whi ][ ch can neither be reached ][  ][ nor exceeded by any real body. ][  ][ Of course this feature of the velocity c as a lim
iting ve ][ locity also ][  ][ clearly follows from the equations of the Lorentz transformation, for ][  ][ these became meaning
less if we c ][ hoose values of v greater than c. ][  ][ If, on the contrary, we had considered a metre-rod at rest in the ][  ]
[ x-axis with re ][ spect to K, then we should have found that the length of ][  ][ the rod as judged from K1 would have been eq
. 06 ; ][  ][ this i ][ s quite in accordance with the principle of relativity which ][  ][ forms the basis of our consideration
s. ][  ][ A Priori it is ][  quite clear that we must be able to learn something ][  ][ about the physical behaviour of measurin
g-rods and clocks from the ] ][ [  ][ equations of transformation, for the magnitudes z, y, x, t, are ][  ][ nothing more nor le
ss than the results of measureme ][ nts obtainable by ][  ][ means of measuring-rods and clocks. If we had based our considerati
ons ][  ][ on the Galileian transfor ][ mation we should not have obtained a ][  ][ contraction of the rod as a consequence of i
ts motion. ][  ][ Let us now consider a  ][ seconds-clock which is permanently situated at ][  ][ the origin (x1=0) of K1. t1=0 
and t1=I are two successive ticks of ][  ][  ][ this clock. The first and fourth equations of the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation 
give for these two ticks : ][  ][                ][                   t = 0 ][  ][ and ][  ][                         eq. 07: fi

ADDITION OF VELOCITIES. ][  ][ THE EXPERIMENT OF FIZEAU ][  ][ Now i ][ n practice we can move clocks and measuring-rods only wi
th ][  ][ velocities that are small compared with the velocity of light; ][  hence ][  ][ we shall hardly be able to compare the
 results of the previous section ][  ][ directly with the reality. But, on t ][ he other hand, these results must ][  ][ strike 
you as being very singular, and for that reason I shall now ][  ][ draw another  ][ conclusion from the theory, one which can ea
sily be ][  ][ derived from the foregoing considerations, and which has been most ][ ][   ][ elegantly confirmed by experiment. 
][  ][ In Section 6 we derived the theorem of the addition of velocities ][  ][ in one d ][ irection in the form which also resu
lts from the hypotheses of ][  ][ classical mechanics- This theorem can also be deduced read ][ ily horn the ][  ][ Galilei tran
sformation (Section 11). In place of the man walking ][  ][ inside the carriage, we introduce a  ][ point moving relatively to t
he ][  ][ co-ordinate system K1 in accordance with the equation ][  ][                               ][   x1 = wt1 ][  ][ By mea
ns of the first and fourth equations of the Galilei ][  ][ transformation we can express x1 and t1 in te ][ rms of x and t, and 
we ][  ][ then obtain ][  ][                              x = (v + w)t ][  ][ This equation expresses nothin ][ g else than the 
law of motion of the ][  ][ point with reference to the system K (of the man with reference to the ][  ][ embank ][ ment). We de
note this velocity by the symbol W, and we then ][  ][ obtain, as in Section 6, ][  ][                            W= ][ v+w     
    A) ][  ][ But we can carry out this consideration just as well on the basis of ][  ][ the theory of relativity. In t ][ he e
quation ][  ][                          x1 = wt1         B) ][  ][ we must then express x1and t1 in terms of x and t, making ][ 
 use of the ][  ][ first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation. Instead of ][  ][ the equation (A) we then obtain t
 ][ he equation ][  ][                         eq. 09: file eq09.gif ][  ][ which corresponds to the theorem of addition for vel
ocit ][ ies in one ][  ][ direction according to the theory of relativity. The question now ][  ][ arises as to which of these t
wo theor ][ ems is the better in accord with ][  ][ experience. On this point we axe enlightened by a most important ][  ][ expe
riment which ][  the brilliant physicist Fizeau performed more than ][  ][ half a century ago, and which has been repeated since
 then by some of ][  ][  ][ the best experimental physicists, so that there can be no doubt about ][  ][ its result. The experim
ent is concerned wit ][ h the following question. ][  ][ Light travels in a motionless liquid with a particular velocity w. How 
][  ][ quickly does it t ][ ravel in the direction of the arrow in the tube T ][  ][ (see the accompanying diagram, Fig. 3) when
 the liquid above ][  ][ men ][ tioned is flowing through the tube with a velocity v ? ][  ][ In accordance with the principle o
f relativity we shall certainly  ][ have ][  ][ to take for granted that the propagation of light always takes place ][  ][ with
 the same velocity w with respect to ][  the liquid, whether the ][  ][ latter is in motion with reference to other bodies or no
t. The ][  ][ velocity of light relative ][  to the liquid and the velocity of the ][  ][ latter relative to the tube are thus k
nown, and we require the ][  ][ velocity of  ][ light relative to the tube. ][  ][ It is clear that we have the problem of Secti
on 6 again before us. The ][  ][ tube plays the  ][ part of the railway embankment or of the co-ordinate ][  ][ system K, the li
quid plays the part of the carriage or of the ][  ][ ][  co-ordinate system K1, and finally, the light plays the part of the ][ 
 ][                       Figure 03: file fig03.gif ][   ][ ][ man walking along the carriage, or of the moving point in the pre
sent ][  ][ section. If we denote the velocity of the light  ][ relative to the tube ][  ][ by W, then this is given by the equa
tion (A) or (B), according as the ][  ][ Galilei transformation  ][ or the Lorentz transformation corresponds to ][  ][ the fact
s. Experiment * decides in favour of equation (B) derived ][  ][ fro ][ m the theory of relativity, and the agreement is, indeed
, very ][  ][ exact. According to recent and most excellent measurements ][  by Zeeman, ][  ][ the influence of the velocity of 
flow v on the propagation of light is ][  ][ represented by formula (B) to w ][ ithin one per cent. ][  ][ Nevertheless we must 
now draw attention to the fact that a theory of ][  ][ this phenomenon was given ][  by H. A. Lorentz long before the statement 
][  ][ of the theory of relativity. This theory was of a purely ][  ][ electrodynami ][ cal nature, and was obtained by the use 
of particular ][  ][ hypotheses as to the electromagnetic structure of matter. This ][   ][ ][ circumstance, however, does not i
n the least diminish the ][  ][ conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial test in favour ][  of the ][  ][ theory of relativ
ity, for the electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz, on ][  ][ which the original theory was based,  ][ in no way opposes the theory
 of ][  ][ relativity. Rather has the latter been developed trom electrodynamics ][  ][ as an astoun ][ dingly simple combinatio
n and generalisation of the ][  ][ hypotheses, formerly independent of each other, on which ][  ][ elect ][ rodynamics was built
. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) Fizeau found eq. 10 , where eq. 11 ][  ][ is the index of refraction of the liqui ][ d. On the other 
hand, owing to ][  ][ the smallness of eq. 12 as compared with I, ][  ][ we can replace (B) in the first place b ][ y eq. 13 , o
r to the same order ][  ][ of approximation by ][  ][ eq. 14 , which agrees with Fizeau's result. ][  ][ THE HEURIST ][ IC VALUE
 OF THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ Our train of thought in the foregoing pages can be epitomised in the ][  ][ followin ][ g ma
nner. Experience has led to the conviction that, on the ][  ][ one hand, the principle of relativity holds true and that on  ][ 
the other ][  ][ hand the velocity of transmission of light in vacuo has to be ][  ][ considered equal to a constant c. By uniti
 ][ ng these two postulates we ][  ][ obtained the law of transformation for the rectangular co-ordinates x, ][  ][ y, z and the
 tim ][ e t of the events which constitute the processes of ][  ][ nature. In this connection we did not obtain the Galilei ][  
][ trans ][ formation, but, differing from classical mechanics, the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation. ][  ][ The law of transmissio
n of light,  ][ the acceptance of which is justified ][  ][ by our actual knowledge, played an important part in this process of
 ][  ][ thought. ][  Once in possession of the Lorentz transformation, however, we ][  ][ can combine this with the principle of
 relativity, and sum ][  up the ][  ][ theory thus: ][  ][ Every general law of nature must be so constituted that it is ][  ][ 
transformed into a law o ][ f exactly the same form when, instead of the ][  ][ space-time variables x, y, z, t of the original 
coordinate system K, ][  ][  ][ we introduce new space-time variables x1, y1, z1, t1 of a co-ordinate ][  ][ system K1. In this 
connection the relation between  ][ the ordinary and ][  ][ the accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz transformation. Or i
n ][  ][ brief : General laws of nat ][ ure are co-variant with respect to Lorentz ][  ][ transformations. ][  ][ This is a defi
nite mathematical condition that the the ][ ory of ][  ][ relativity demands of a natural law, and in virtue of this, the theory
 ][  ][ becomes a valuable heuristic aid in  ][ the search for general laws of ][  ][ nature. If a general law of nature were to
 be found which did not ][  ][ satisfy this cond ][ ition, then at least one of the two fundamental ][  ][ assumptions of the th
eory would have been disproved. Let us now ][  ][ ex ][ amine what general results the latter theory has hitherto evinced. ][  ]
[ GENERAL RESULTS OF THE THEORY ][  ][ It is clear from  ][ our previous considerations that the (special) theory ][  ][ of rela
tivity has grown out of electrodynamics and optics. In these ][  ][  ][ fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions of
 theory, but ][  ][ it has considerably simplified the theoretic ][ al structure, i.e. the ][  ][ derivation of laws, and -- wha
t is incomparably more important -- it ][  ][ has considerably reduc ][ ed the number of independent hypothese forming ][  ][ th
e basis of theory. The special theory of relativity has rendered the ][  ][  ][ Maxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the la
tter would have been ][  ][ generally accepted by physicists even if experim ][ ent had decided less ][  ][ unequivocally in its
 favour. ][  ][ Classical mechanics required to be modified before it could come ][  into ][  ][ line with the demands of the sp
ecial theory of relativity. For the ][  ][ main part, however, this modification aff ][ ects only the laws for rapid ][  ][ moti
ons, in which the velocities of matter v are not very small as ][  ][ compared with the  ][ velocity of light. We have experienc
e of such rapid ][  ][ motions only in the case of electrons and ions; for other motions the ][  ][  ][ variations from the laws
 of classical mechanics are too small to make ][  ][ themselves evident in practice. We shall no ][ t consider the motion of ][ 
 ][ stars until we come to speak of the general theory of relativity. In ][  ][ accordance with the  ][ theory of relativity the
 kinetic energy of a ][  ][ material point of mass m is no longer given by the well-known ][  ][ express ][ ion ][  ][          
               eq. 15: file eq15.gif ][  ][ but by the expression ][  ][                         eq. 16: fil ][ e eq16.gif ][  ]
[ This expression approaches infinity as the velocity v approaches the ][  ][ velocity of light c. The velocity  ][ must therefo
re always remain less ][  ][ than c, however great may be the energies used to produce the ][  ][ acceleration. If w ][ e develo
p the expression for the kinetic energy in ][  ][ the form of a series, we obtain ][  ][                         eq. 17: ][  fil
e eq17.gif ][  ][ When eq. 18 is small compared with unity, the third of these terms is ][  ][ always small in comparison wi ][ 
th the second, ][  ][ which last is alone considered in classical mechanics. The first term ][  ][ mc^2 does not contain the vel
 ][ ocity, and requires no consideration if ][  ][ we are only dealing with the question as to how the energy of a ][  ][ point-
mass ][ ; depends on the velocity. We shall speak of its essential ][  ][ significance later. ][  ][ The most important result o
f a gene ][ ral character to which the special ][  ][ theory of relativity has led is concerned with the conception of mass. ][ 
 ][ Before t ][ he advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation ][  ][ laws of fundamental importance, namely, the 
law of the canse ][ rvation of ][  ][ energy and the law of the conservation of mass these two fundamental ][  ][ laws appeared 
to be quite independ ][ ent of each other. By means of the ][  ][ theory of relativity they have been united into one law. We sh
all now ][  ][ briefly c ][ onsider how this unification came about, and what meaning is ][  ][ to be attached to it. ][  ][ The
 principle of relativity req ][ uires that the law of the concervation ][  ][ of energy should hold not only with reference to a
 co-ordinate system ][  ][ K, bu ][ t also with respect to every co-ordinate system K1 which is in a ][  ][ state of uniform mot
ion of translation relative to K, or ][ , briefly, ][  ][ relative to every " Galileian " system of co-ordinates. In contrast to
 ][  ][ classical mechanics; the Lorentz ][  transformation is the deciding factor ][  ][ in the transition from one such system
 to another. ][  ][ By means of comparativel ][ y simple considerations we are led to draw the ][  ][ following conclusion from 
these premises, in conjunction with the ][  ][ f ][ undamental equations of the electrodynamics of Maxwell: A body moving ][  ][
 with the velocity v, which absorbs * an amount of e ][ nergy E[0] in ][  ][ the form of radiation without suffering an alterati
on in velocity in ][  ][ the process, has, as a conseque ][ nce, its energy increased by an amount ][  ][                       
  eq. 19: file eq19.gif ][  ][ In consideration of the expre ][ ssion given above for the kinetic energy ][  ][ of the body, the
 required energy of the body comes out to be ][  ][              ][             eq. 20: file eq20.gif ][  ][ Thus the body has t
he same energy as a body of mass ][  ][                          eq. ][ 21: file eq21.gif ][  ][ moving with the velocity v. Hen
ce we can say: If a body takes up an ][  ][ amount of energy E[0], then  ][ its inertial mass increases by an amount ][  ][     
                    eq. 22: file eq22.gif ][  ][ the inertial mass of a body ][  is not a constant but varies according to ][  ]
[ the change in the energy of the body. The inertial mass of a system of ][  ][  ][ bodies can even be regarded as a measure of 
its energy. The law of the ][  ][ conservation of the mass of a system becomes ident ][ ical with the law of ][  ][ the conserva
tion of energy, and is only valid provided that the system ][  ][ neither takes up nor s ][ ends out energy. Writing the express
ion for the ][  ][ energy in the form ][  ][                         eq. 23: file eq23.gif ] ][ [  ][ we see that the term mc^2,
 which has hitherto attracted our attention, ][  ][ is nothing else than the energy possessed by ][  the body ** before it ][  ]
[ absorbed the energy E[0]. ][  ][ A direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not possi ][ ble ][  ][ at the presen
t time (1920; see *** Note, p. 48), owing to the fact that ][  ][ the changes in energy E[0] to which we ][  can Subject a syste
m are not ][  ][ large enough to make themselves perceptible as a change in the ][  ][ inertial mass of the  ][ system. ][  ][  
                               eq. 22: file eq22.gif ][  ][ is too small in comparison with the mass m, which wa ][ s present be
fore ][  ][ the alteration of the energy. It is owing to this circumstance that ][  ][ classical mechanics was able  ][ to estab
lish successfully the ][  ][ conservation of mass as a law of independent validity. ][  ][ Let me add a final remark of  ][ a fu
ndamental nature. The success of the ][  ][ Faraday-Maxwell interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance ][  ][ re ][ 
sulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such ][  ][ things as instantaneous actions at a distance (not involvi
 ][ ng an ][  ][ intermediary medium) of the type of Newton's law of gravitation. ][  ][ According to the theory of relativity, 
acti ][ on at a distance with the ][  ][ velocity of light always takes the place of instantaneous action at a ][  ][ distance o
r of act ][ ion at a distance with an infinite velocity of ][  ][ transmission. This is connected with the fact that the velocit
y c ][  ][ p ][ lays a fundamental role in this theory. In Part II we shall see in ][  ][ what way this result becomes modified 
in the general t ][ heory of ][  ][ relativity. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) E[0] is the energy taken up, as judged from a co-ordina
te system ][  ][ mov ][ ing with the body. ][  ][ **) As judged from a co-ordinate system moving with the body. ][  ][ ***[Note]
 The equation E = mc^2 h ][ as been thoroughly proved time and ][  ][ again since this time. ][  ][ EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIAL T
HEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ T ][ o what extent is the special theory of relativity supported by ][  ][ experience?  This question
 is not easily answered for the  ][ reason ][  ][ already mentioned in connection with the fundamental experiment of ][  ][ Fize
au. The special theory of relativity ][  has crystallised out from the ][  ][ Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electromagnetic phenomen
a. Thus all facts of ][  ][ experience w ][ hich support the electromagnetic theory also support the ][  ][ theory of relativity
. As being of particular importance, I menti ][ on ][  ][ here the fact that the theory of relativity enables us to predict the 
][  ][ effects produced on the light reaching us ][  from the fixed stars. These ][  ][ results are obtained in an exceedingly s
imple manner, and the effects ][  ][ indicated, whic ][ h are due to the relative motion of the earth with ][  ][ reference to t
hose fixed stars are found to be in accord with ][  ][ e ][ xperience. We refer to the yearly movement of the apparent position 
][  ][ of the fixed stars resulting from the motion of the e ][ arth round the ][  ][ sun (aberration), and to the influence of 
the radial components of the ][  ][ relative motions of the fixe ][ d stars with respect to the earth on the ][  ][ colour of th
e light reaching us from them. The latter effect manifests ][  ][ it ][ self in a slight displacement of the spectral lines of t
he light ][  ][ transmitted to us from a fixed star, as compared with th ][ e position of ][  ][ the same spectral lines when th
ey are produced by a terrestrial source ][  ][ of light (Doppler principle). ][  The experimental arguments in favour of ][  ][ 
the Maxwell-Lorentz theory, which are at the same time arguments in ][  ][ favou ][ r of the theory of relativity, are too numer
ous to be set forth ][  ][ here. In reality they limit the theoretical possibilities ][  to such an ][  ][ extent, that no other
 theory than that of Maxwell and Lorentz has been ][  ][ able to hold its own when teste ][ d by experience. ][  ][ But there ar
e two classes of experimental facts hitherto obtained ][  ][ which can be represented in the ][  Maxwell-Lorentz theory only by 
the ][  ][ introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis, which in itself -- i.e. ][  ][ without makin ][ g use of the theory of relat
ivity -- appears extraneous. ][  ][ It is known that cathode rays and the so-called b-rays emitted b ][ y ][  ][ radioactive sub
stances consist of negatively electrified particles ][  ][ (electrons) of very small inertia and large v ][ elocity. By examinin
g the ][  ][ deflection of these rays under the influence of electric and magnetic ][  ][ fields, we can stu ][ dy the law of mo
tion of these particles very ][  ][ exactly. ][  ][ In the theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are face ][ d with the ]
[  ][ difficulty that electrodynamic theory of itself is unable to give an ][  ][ account of their nature. For since ][  electri
cal masses of one sign repel ][  ][ each other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron ][  ][ would ne ][ cess
arily be scattered under the influence of their mutual ][  ][ repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating  ][ 
between ][  ][ them, the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us.*   If ][  ][ we now assume that the relative dista
 ][ nces between the electrical ][  ][ masses constituting the electron remain unchanged during the motion of ][  ][ the electro
n (r ][ igid connection in the sense of classical mechanics), ][  ][ we arrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not
 agree w ][ ith ][  ][ experience. Guided by purely formal points of view, H. A. Lorentz was ][  ][ the first to introduce the h
ypothesis th ][ at the form of the electron ][  ][ experiences a contraction in the direction of motion in consequence of ][  ][
 that motion. th ][ e contracted length being proportional to the ][  ][ expression ][  ][                         eq. 05: file 
eq05.gif ][  ][ This ][ , hypothesis, which is not justifiable by any electrodynamical ][  ][ facts, supplies us then with that 
particular law of motion ][  which has ][  ][ been confirmed with great precision in recent years. ][  ][ The theory of relativi
ty leads to the same law of  ][ motion, without ][  ][ requiring any special hypothesis whatsoever as to the structure and ][  ]
[ the behaviour of the electron. ][  We arrived at a similar conclusion in ][  ][ Section 13 in connection with the experiment o
f Fizeau, the result ][  ][ of which ][  is foretold by the theory of relativity without the necessity ][  ][ of drawing on hypo
theses as to the physical nature of the  ][ liquid. ][  ][ The second class of facts to which we have alluded has reference to ]
[  ][ the question whether or not the motion ][  of the earth in space can be ][  ][ made perceptible in terrestrial experiments
. We have already remarked ][  ][ in Section 5 t ][ hat all attempts of this nature led to a negative ][  ][ result. Before the 
theory of relativity was put forward, it was ][  ][  ][ difficult to become reconciled to this negative result, for reasons ][  
][ now to be discussed. The inherited prejudices about t ][ ime and space did ][  ][ not allow any doubt to arise as to the prim
e importance of the ][  ][ Galileian transformation for chan ][ ging over from one body of reference ][  ][ to another. Now assu
ming that the Maxwell-Lorentz equations hold for a ][  ][ refere ][ nce-body K, we then find that they do not hold for a ][  ][ 
reference-body K1 moving uniformly with respect to K, if we assume ] ][ [  ][ that the relations of the Galileian transformstion
 exist between the ][  ][ co-ordinates of K and K1. It thus appears that ][ , of all Galileian ][  ][ co-ordinate systems, one (
K) corresponding to a particular state of ][  ][ motion is physically unique ][ . This result was interpreted physically by ][  
][ regarding K as at rest with respect to a hypothetical ther of space. ][  ][  ][ On the other hand, all coordinate systems K1 
moving relatively to K ][  ][ were to be regarded as in motion with respect to the  ][ ther. To this ][  ][ motion of K1 against
 the ther ("ther-drift " relative to K1) were ][  ][ attributed the more complicated ][  laws which were supposed to hold ][  ][
 relative to K1. Strictly speaking, such an ther-drift ought also to ][  ][ be assumed  ][ relative to the earth, and for a long
 time the efforts of ][  ][ physicists were devoted to attempts to detect the existence of  ][ an ][  ][ ther-drift at the earth
's surface. ][  ][ In one of the most notable of these attempts Michelson devised a ][  ][ met ][ hod which appears as though it
 must be decisive. Imagine two ][  ][ mirrors so arranged on a rigid body that the reflecting surf ][ aces face ][  ][ each othe
r. A ray of light requires a perfectly definite time T to ][  ][ pass from one mirror to the other and ][  back again, if the wh
ole system ][  ][ be at rest with respect to the ther. It is found by calculation, ][  ][ however, that a ][  slightly different
 time T1 is required for this ][  ][ process, if the body, together with the mirrors, be moving relatively ][ ][   ][ to the the
r. And yet another point: it is shown by calculation that ][  ][ for a given velocity v with reference to the t ][ her, this tim
e T1 is ][  ][ different when the body is moving perpendicularly to the planes of the ][  ][ mirrors from that resu ][ lting whe
n the motion is parallel to these ][  ][ planes. Although the estimated difference between these two times is ][  ][ ex ][ ceedi
ngly small, Michelson and Morley performed an experiment ][  ][ involving interference in which this difference should have ][  
been ][  ][ clearly detectable. But the experiment gave a negative result -- a ][  ][ fact very perplexing to physicists. Loren 
][ tz and FitzGerald rescued the ][  ][ theory from this difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body ][  ][ relative to t
he  ][ ther produces a contraction of the body in the ][  ][ direction of motion, the amount of contraction being just sufficien
t ][   ][ ][ to compensate for the differeace in time mentioned above. Comparison ][  ][ with the discussion in Section 11 shows
 that also ][  from the ][  ][ standpoint of the theory of relativity this solution of the difficulty ][  ][ was the right one. 
But on the bas ][ is of the theory of relativity the ][  ][ method of interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory. Accordin
g ][  ][ to this t ][ heory there is no such thing as a " specially favoured " ][  ][ (unique) co-ordinate system to occasion th
e introduction of the  ][ ][  ][ ther-idea, and hence there can be no ther-drift, nor any experiment ][  ][ with which to demons
trate it. Here the contr ][ action of moving bodies ][  ][ follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory, without th
e ][  ][ introduction of par ][ ticular hypotheses ; and as the prime factor ][  ][ involved in this contraction we find, not th
e motion in itself, to ][  ][ wh ][ ich we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with respect to the ][  ][ body of referenc
e chosen in the particular case in p ][ oint. Thus for a ][  ][ co-ordinate system moving with the earth the mirror system of ][
  ][ Michelson and Morley is not shorten ][ ed, but it is shortened for a ][  ][ co-ordinate system which is at rest relatively 
to the sun. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) The gen ][ eral theory of relativity renders it likely that the ][  ][ electrical masses of
 an electron are held together by gravitational  ][ ][  ][ forces. ][  ][ MINKOWSKI'S FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACE ][  ][ The non-math
ematician is seized by a mysterious shuddering when  ][ he ][  ][ hears of "four-dimensional" things, by a feeling not unlike th
at ][  ][ awakened by thoughts of the occult. And yet th ][ ere is no more ][  ][ common-place statement than that the world in 
which we live is a ][  ][ four-dimensional space-time contin ][ uum. ][  ][ Space is a three-dimensional continuum. By this we m
ean that it is ][  ][ possible to describe the position of a poi ][ nt (at rest) by means of ][  ][ three numbers (co-ordinales)
 x, y, z, and that there is an indefinite ][  ][ number of points in ][  the neighbourhood of this one, the position of ][  ][ w
hich can be described by co-ordinates such as x[1], y[1], z[1], which ][ ][   ][ may be as near as we choose to the respective v
alues of the ][  ][ co-ordinates x, y, z, of the first point. In virtue of t ][ he latter ][  ][ property we speak of a " contin
uum," and owing to the fact that there ][  ][ are three co-ordinates we speak of ][  it as being " three-dimensional." ][  ][ Si
milarly, the world of physical phenomena which was briefly called " ][  ][ world " b ][ y Minkowski is naturally four dimensiona
l in the space-time ][  ][ sense. For it is composed of individual events, each of which ][  is ][  ][ described by four numbers
, namely, three space co-ordinates x, y, z, ][  ][ and a time co-ordinate, the time value t. ][  The" world" is in this sense ][
  ][ also a continuum; for to every event there are as many "neighbouring" ][  ][ events (realis ][ ed or at least thinkable) as
 we care to choose, the ][  ][ co-ordinates x[1], y[1], z[1], t[1] of which differ by an indefinitel ][ y ][  ][ small amount fr
om those of the event x, y, z, t originally considered. ][  ][ That we have not been accustomed to regar ][ d the world in this 
sense as ][  ][ a four-dimensional continuum is due to the fact that in physics, ][  ][ before the advent of ][  the theory of r
elativity, time played a different ][  ][ and more independent role, as compared with the space coordinates. It  ][ ][  ][ is fo
r this reason that we have been in the habit of treating time as ][  ][ an independent continuum. As a matter of fac ][ t, accor
ding to classical ][  ][ mechanics, time is absolute, i.e. it is independent of the position ][  ][ and the condition of ][  mot
ion of the system of co-ordinates. We see this ][  ][ expressed in the last equation of the Galileian transformation (t1 = ] ][ 
[  ][ t) ][  ][ The four-dimensional mode of consideration of the "world" is natural ][  ][ on the theory of relativity, since a
 ][ ccording to this theory time is ][  ][ robbed of its independence. This is shown by the fourth equation of ][  ][ the Lorent
z tr ][ ansformation: ][  ][                         eq. 24: file eq24.gif ][  ][ Moreover, according to this equation the time 
differen ][ ce Dt1 of two ][  ][ events with respect to K1 does not in general vanish, even when the ][  ][ time difference Dt1 
of the same  ][ events with reference to K vanishes. ][  ][ Pure " space-distance " of two events with respect to K results in "
 ][  ][ time-dis ][ tance " of the same events with respect to K. But the ][  ][ discovery of Minkowski, which was of importance
 for the formal ][   ][ ][ development of the theory of relativity, does not lie here. It is to ][  ][ be found rather in the fa
ct of his recognition th ][ at the ][  ][ four-dimensional space-time continuum of the theory of relativity, in ][  ][ its most 
essential formal properties, ][  shows a pronounced relationship ][  ][ to the three-dimensional continuum of Euclidean geometri
cal ][  ][ space.*  In order to  ][ give due prominence to this relationship, ][  ][ however, we must replace the usual time co-
ordinate t by an imaginary ][  ][ ma ][ gnitude eq. 25 proportional to it. Under these conditions, the ][  ][ natural laws satis
fying the demands of the (special) theor ][ y of ][  ][ relativity assume mathematical forms, in which the time co-ordinate ][  
][ plays exactly the same role as the three  ][ space co-ordinates. Formally, ][  ][ these four co-ordinates correspond exactly 
to the three space ][  ][ co-ordinates in Euclid ][ ean geometry. It must be clear even to the ][  ][ non-mathematician that, as
 a consequence of this purely formal ][  ][ addition ][  to our knowledge, the theory perforce gained clearness in no ][  ][ mea
n measure. ][  ][ These inadequate remarks can give the  ][ reader only a vague notion of ][  ][ the important idea contributed 
by Minkowski. Without it the general ][  ][ theory of relati ][ vity, of which the fundamental ideas are developed in ][  ][ the
 following pages, would perhaps have got no farther than its lon ][ g ][  ][ clothes. Minkowski's work is doubtless difficult of
 access to anyone ][  ][ inexperienced in mathematics, but since it  ][ is not necessary to have a ][  ][ very exact grasp of th
is work in order to understand the fundamental ][  ][ ideas of either th ][ e special or the general theory of relativity, I ][ 
 ][ shall leave it here at present, and revert to it only towards the end ][ ][   ][ of Part 2. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) Cf. the
 somewhat more detailed discussion in Appendix II. ][  ][ PART II ][  ][ THE GEN ][ ERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ SPECIAL AND
 GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ The basal principle, which was the pivot of  ][ all our previous ][  ][ considerations, 
was the special principle of relativity, i.e. the ][  ][ principle of the physical relat ][ ivity of all uniform motion. Let as 
][  ][ once more analyse its meaning carefully. ][  ][ It was at all times clear that, from  ][ the point of view of the idea it
 ][  ][ conveys to us, every motion must be considered only as a relative ][  ][ motion. Returni ][ ng to the illustration we ha
ve frequently used of the ][  ][ embankment and the railway carriage, we can express the fact of the ][  ][  ][ motion here taki
ng place in the following two forms, both of which are ][  ][ equally justifiable : ][  ][ (a) The carri ][ age is in motion rel
ative to the embankment, ][  ][ (b) The embankment is in motion relative to the carriage. ][  ][ In (a) the  ][ embankment, in (
b) the carriage, serves as the body of ][  ][ reference in our statement of the motion taking place. If it is si ][ mply ][  ][ 
a question of detecting or of describing the motion involved, it is in ][  ][ principle immaterial to what reference ][ -body we
 refer the motion. As ][  ][ already mentioned, this is self-evident, but it must not be confused ][  ][ with the much m ][ ore 
comprehensive statement called "the principle of ][  ][ relativity," which we have taken as the basis of our investigations. ][ 
 ][  ][ The principle we have made use of not only maintains that we may ][  ][ equally well choose the carriage or the embankme
 ][ nt as our ][  ][ reference-body for the description of any event (for this, too, is ][  ][ self-evident). Our principle rath
er a ][ sserts what follows : If we ][  ][ formulate the general laws of nature as they are obtained from ][  ][ experience, by 
making u ][ se of ][  ][ (a) the embankment as reference-body, ][  ][ (b) the railway carriage as reference-body, ][  ][ then th
ese general  ][ laws of nature (e.g. the laws of mechanics or the ][  ][ law of the propagation of light in vacuo) have exactly 
the same form ][ ][   ][ in both cases. This can also be expressed as follows : For the ][  ][ physical description of natural p
rocesses, neither of ][  the reference ][  ][ bodies K, K1 is unique (lit. " specially marked out ") as compared ][  ][ with the
 other. Unlike the first ][ , this latter statement need not of ][  ][ necessity hold a priori; it is not contained in the conce
ptions of " ][  ][ motion" a ][ nd " reference-body " and derivable from them; only ][  ][ experience can decide as to its corre
ctness or incorrectness. ][  ][  ][ Up to the present, however, we have by no means maintained the ][  ][ equivalence of all bod
ies of reference K in connection wit ][ h the ][  ][ formulation of natural laws. Our course was more on the following ][  ][ Ii
nes. In the first place, we started out  ][ from the assumption that ][  ][ there exists a reference-body K, whose condition of 
motion is such ][  ][ that the Galileian law ][  holds with respect to it : A particle left to ][  ][ itself and sufficiently fa
r removed from all other particles moves ][  ][  ][ uniformly in a straight line. With reference to K (Galileian ][  ][ referenc
e-body) the laws of nature were to be as simple as p ][ ossible. ][  ][ But in addition to K, all bodies of reference K1 should 
be given ][  ][ preference in this sense, and they shoul ][ d be exactly equivalent to K ][  ][ for the formulation of natural l
aws, provided that they are in a state ][  ][ of uniform rec ][ tilinear and non-rotary motion with respect to K ; all ][  ][ th
ese bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian ][  ][ r ][ eference-bodies. The validity of the principle of relativity
 was ][  ][ assumed only for these reference-bodies, but not for oth ][ ers (e.g. ][  ][ those possessing motion of a different 
kind). In this sense we speak ][  ][ of the special principle of relativ ][ ity, or special theory of ][  ][ relativity. ][  ][ 
In contrast to this we wish to understand by the "general principle of ][  ] ][ [ relativity" the following statement : All bodi
es of reference K, K1, ][  ][ etc., are equivalent for the description of natura ][ l phenomena ][  ][ (formulation of the gener
al laws of nature), whatever may be their ][  ][ state of motion. But before proceed ][ ing farther, it ought to be pointed ][  
][ out that this formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract ][  ][ one, for r ][ easons which will become evident at 
a later stage. ][  ][ Since the introduction of the special principle of relativity has been ][  ][  ][ justified, every intelle
ct which strives after generalisation must ][  ][ feel the temptation to venture the step toward ][ s the general principle ][  
][ of relativity. But a simple and apparently quite reliable ][  ][ consideration seems to suggest t ][ hat, for the present at 
any rate, ][  ][ there is little hope of success in such an attempt; Let us imagine ][  ][ ourselves tra ][ nsferred to our old 
friend the railway carriage, which is ][  ][ travelling at a uniform rate. As long as it is moving unifromly ][ , the ][  ][ occ
upant of the carriage is not sensible of its motion, and it is for ][  ][ this reason that he can without reluct ][ ance interpr
et the facts of the ][  ][ case as indicating that the carriage is at rest, but the embankment in ][  ][ motion. Mor ][ eover, a
ccording to the special principle of relativity, ][  ][ this interpretation is quite justified also from a physical poin ][ t of
 ][  ][ view. ][  ][ If the motion of the carriage is now changed into a non-uniform ][  ][ motion, as for instance by a pow ][ 
erful application of the brakes, then ][  ][ the occupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful ][  ][ jerk for
 ][ wards. The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical ][  ][ behaviour of bodies relative to the person in the railway 
carr ][ iage. ][  ][ The mechanical behaviour is different from that of the case previously ][  ][ considered, and for this reas
on it wo ][ uld appear to be impossible that ][  ][ the same mechanical laws hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving ][  ][ 
carriage, as ][  hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in ][  ][ uniform motion. At all events it is clear that th
e Galileian law  ][ does ][  ][ not hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because of ][  ][ this, we feel comp
elled at the present ][  juncture to grant a kind of ][  ][ absolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to th
e ][  ][ general princip ][ le of relatvity. But in what follows we shall soon see ][  ][ that this conclusion cannot be maintai
ned. ][  ][ THE GRAVITATIONA ][ L FIELD ][  ][ "If we pick up a stone and then let it go, why does it fall to the ][  ][ ground 
?" The usual answer to this ques ][ tion is: "Because it is ][  ][ attracted by the earth." Modern physics formulates the answer
 rather ][  ][ differently for the f ][ ollowing reason. As a result of the more careful ][  ][ study of electromagnetic phenome
na, we have come to regard action at a ] ][ [  ][ distance as a process impossible without the intervention of some ][  ][ inter
mediary medium. If, for instance, a magnet a ][ ttracts a piece of ][  ][ iron, we cannot be content to regard this as meaning t
hat the magnet ][  ][ acts directly on the iron  ][ through the intermediate empty space, but we ][  ][ are constrained to imagi
ne -- after the manner of Faraday -- that the ][  ][ ][  magnet always calls into being something physically real in the space ]
[  ][ around it, that something being what we call a "ma ][ gnetic field." In ][  ][ its turn this magnetic field operates on th
e piece of iron, so that ][  ][ the latter strives to move t ][ owards the magnet. We shall not discuss ][  ][ here the justific
ation for this incidental conception, which is indeed ][  ][ a s ][ omewhat arbitrary one. We shall only mention that with its a
id ][  ][ electromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically represented ][  much more ][  ][ satisfactorily than without it, and th
is applies particularly to the ][  ][ transmission of electromagnetic wa ][ ves. The effects of gravitation also ][  ][ are rega
rded in an analogous manner. ][  ][ The action of the earth on the stone tak ][ es place indirectly. The earth ][  ][ produces i
n its surrounding a gravitational field, which acts on the ][  ][ stone and prod ][ uces its motion of fall. As we know from exp
erience, the ][  ][ intensity of the action on a body dimishes according to a quite  ][ ][  ][ definite law, as we proceed farth
er and farther away from the earth. ][  ][ From our point of view this means : The law g ][ overning the properties ][  ][ of th
e gravitational field in space must be a perfectly definite one, ][  ][ in order correctly t ][ o represent the diminution of gr
avitational action ][  ][ with the distance from operative bodies. It is something like this: ][ ][   ][ The body (e.g. the eart
h) produces a field in its immediate ][  ][ neighbourhood directly; the intensity and direction of t ][ he field at ][  ][ point
s farther removed from the body are thence determined by the law ][  ][ which governs the properties in  ][ space of the gravita
tional fields ][  ][ themselves. ][  ][ In contrast to electric and magnetic fields, the gravitational field ][  ][  ][ exhibits
 a most remarkable property, which is of fundamental ][  ][ importance for what follows. Bodies which are moving ][  under the s
ole ][  ][ influence of a gravitational field receive an acceleration, which does ][  ][ not in the least depend eit ][ her on t
he material or on the physical ][  ][ state of the body. For instance, a piece of lead and a piece of wood ][  ][ fall i ][ n ex
actly the same manner in a gravitational field (in vacuo), ][  ][ when they start off from rest or with the same initial vel ][ 
ocity. This ][  ][ law, which holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form ][  ][ in the light of the following c
 ][ onsideration. ][  ][ According to Newton's law of motion, we have ][  ][ (Force) = (inertial mass) x (acceleration), ][  ][ 
wher ][ e the "inertial mass" is a characteristic constant of the ][  ][ accelerated body. If now gravitation is the cause of th
e accele ][ ration, ][  ][ we then have ][  ][ (Force) = (gravitational mass) x (intensity of the gravitational ][  ][ field), ]
[  ][ where  ][ the "gravitational mass" is likewise a characteristic constant ][  ][ for the body. From these two relations fol
lows: ][  ][     ][                              eq. 26: file eq26.gif ][  ][ If now, as we find from experience, the accelerati
on is to be ][  ][ i ][ ndependent of the nature and the condition of the body and always the ][  ][ same for a given gravitatio
nal field, then the rati ][ o of the ][  ][ gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the same for all ][  ][ bodies. 
By a suitable choice of unit ][ s we can thus make this ratio ][  ][ equal to unity. We then have the following law: The gravita
tional mass ][  ][ of a body is  ][ equal to its inertial law. ][  ][ It is true that this important law had hitherto been recor
ded in ][  ][ mechanics, but it had  ][ not been interpreted. A satisfactory ][  ][ interpretation can be obtained only if we re
cognise the following fact ][  ][ : The  ][ same quality of a body manifests itself according to ][  ][ circumstances as " inert
ia " or as " weight " (lit. " heaviness ').  ][ In ][  ][ the following section we shall show to what extent this is actually ][
  ][ the case, and how this question is connecte ][ d with the general ][  ][ postulate of relativity. ][  ][ THE EQUALITY OF IN
ERTIAL AND GRAVITATIONAL MASS ][  ][ AS AN ARGUMENT  ][ FOR THE GENERAL POSTULE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ We imagine a large portion 
of empty space, so far removed from stars ][  ][ and oth ][ er appreciable masses, that we have before us approximately the ][  
][ conditions required by the fundamental law of Galilei. It ][  is then ][  ][ possible to choose a Galileian reference-body fo
r this part of space ][  ][ (world), relative to which points at ][  rest remain at rest and points in ][  ][ motion continue pe
rmanently in uniform rectilinear motion. As ][  ][ reference-body le ][ t us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with ][ 
 ][ an observer inside who is equipped with apparatus. Gravitation ][  ] ][ [ naturally does not exist for this observer. He mus
t fasten himself ][  ][ with strings to the floor, otherwise the slightest i ][ mpact against the ][  ][ floor will cause him to
 rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room. ][  ][ To the middle of the lid of ][  the chest is fixed externally a hook with ]
[  ][ rope attached, and now a " being " (what kind of a being is immaterial ][  ][  ][ to us) begins pulling at this with a con
stant force. The chest ][  ][ together with the observer then begin to move "upwards" wi ][ th a ][  ][ uniformly accelerated mo
tion. In course of time their velocity will ][  ][ reach unheard-of values -- provided that  ][ we are viewing all this from ][ 
 ][ another reference-body which is not being pulled with a rope. ][  ][ But how does the man in ][  the chest regard the Proces
s ? The ][  ][ acceleration of the chest will be transmitted to him by the reaction ][  ][ of the fl ][ oor of the chest. He mus
t therefore take up this pressure by ][  ][ means of his legs if he does not wish to be laid out full le ][ ngth on ][  ][ the f
loor. He is then standing in the chest in exactly the same way as ][  ][ anyone stands in a room of a home o ][ n our earth. If 
he releases a body ][  ][ which he previously had in his land, the accelertion of the chest will ][  ][ no longe ][ r be transmi
tted to this body, and for this reason the body ][  ][ will approach the floor of the chest with an accelerated rela ][ tive ][ 
 ][ motion. The observer will further convince himself that the ][  ][ acceleration of the body towards the floor of the ][  che
st is always of ][  ][ the same magnitude, whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the ][  ][ experiment. ][  ][ Rely ][ 
ing on his knowledge of the gravitational field (as it was ][  ][ discussed in the preceding section), the man in the chest will
 ][  thus ][  ][ come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational ][  ][ field which is constant with regard 
to t ][ ime. Of course he will be ][  ][ puzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this ][  ][ gravitational fie
ld. just ][  then, however, he discovers the hook in the ][  ][ middle of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to
 it, ][  ][  ][ and he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chest is ][  ][ suspended at rest in the gravitational fiel
d. ][  ][ Ought  ][ we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion ? ][  ][ I do not believe we ought to if we wi
sh to remain consist ][ ent ; we must ][  ][ rather admit that his mode of grasping the situation violates neither ][  ][ reason
 nor known mechanical la ][ ws. Even though it is being accelerated ][  ][ with respect to the "Galileian space" first considere
d, we can ][  ][ nevertheles ][ s regard the chest as being at rest. We have thus good ][  ][ grounds for extending the principl
e of relativity to include bodie ][ s of ][  ][ reference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a ][  ][ resu
lt we have gained a powerful argumen ][ t for a generalised postulate ][  ][ of relativity. ][  ][ We must note carefully that t
he possibility of this mode of ][  ][ in ][ terpretation rests on the fundamental property of the gravitational ][  ][ field of 
giving all bodies the same acceleration, or, ][  what comes to ][  ][ the same thing, on the law of the equality of inertial and
 ][  ][ gravitational mass. If this natural law  ][ did not exist, the man in the ][  ][ accelerated chest would not be able to 
interpret the behaviour of the ][  ][ bodies around  ][ him on the supposition of a gravitational field, and he ][  ][ would not
 be justified on the grounds of experience in supposing  ][ his ][  ][ reference-body to be " at rest." ][  ][ Suppose that the 
man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of ][  ][ th ][ e lid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope. 
The ][  ][ result of this will be to strech the rope so that it  ][ will hang " ][  ][ vertically " downwards. If we ask for an 
opinion of the cause of ][  ][ tension in the rope, the man in the c ][ hest will say: "The suspended ][  ][ body experiences a 
downward force in the gravitational field, and this ][  ][ is neutralise ][ d by the tension of the rope ; what determines the ]
[  ][ magnitude of the tension of the rope is the gravitational mass of the  ][ ][  ][ suspended body." On the other hand, an ob
server who is poised freely ][  ][ in space will interpret the condition of thin ][ gs thus : " The rope must ][  ][ perforce ta
ke part in the accelerated motion of the chest, and it ][  ][ transmits this motion  ][ to the body attached to it. The tension 
of the ][  ][ rope is just large enough to effect the acceleration of the body. That ][  ][  ][ which determines the magnitude o
f the tension of the rope is the ][  ][ inertial mass of the body." Guided by this example,  ][ we see that our ][  ][ extension
 of the principle of relativity implies the necessity of the ][  ][ law of the equality of inert ][ ial and gravitational mass. 
Thus we have ][  ][ obtained a physical interpretation of this law. ][  ][ From our consideration of ][  the accelerated chest w
e see that a general ][  ][ theory of relativity must yield important results on the laws of ][  ][ grav ][ itation. In point of
 fact, the systematic pursuit of the general ][  ][ idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by th ][ e ][  ][ gravita
tional field. Before proceeding farther, however, I must warn ][  ][ the reader against a misconception suggeste ][ d by these c
onsiderations. ][  ][ A gravitational field exists for the man in the chest, despite the ][  ][ fact that there was  ][ no such 
field for the co-ordinate system first ][  ][ chosen. Now we might easily suppose that the existence of a ][  ][ gravita ][ tion
al field is always only an apparent one. We might also ][  ][ think that, regardless of the kind of gravitational field whic ][ 
h may be ][  ][ present, we could always choose another reference-body such that no ][  ][ gravitational field exists with refer
 ][ ence to it. This is by no means ][  ][ true for all gravitational fields, but only for those of quite special ][  ][ form. I
t is ][ , for instance, impossible to choose a body of reference ][  ][ such that, as judged from it, the gravitational field of
 the ear ][ th (in ][  ][ its entirety) vanishes. ][  ][ We can now appreciate why that argument is not convincing, which we ][ 
 ][ brought  ][ forward against the general principle of relativity at theend ][  ][ of Section 18. It is certainly true that th
e observer in th ][ e ][  ][ railway carriage experiences a jerk forwards as a result of the ][  ][ application of the brake, an
d that he recognises ][ , in this the ][  ][ non-uniformity of motion (retardation) of the carriage. But he is ][  ][ compelled 
by nobody to refer this  ][ jerk to a " real " acceleration ][  ][ (retardation) of the carriage. He might also interpret his ex
perience ][  ][ thus: " My b ][ ody of reference (the carriage) remains permanently at ][  ][ rest. With reference to it, howeve
r, there exists (during the peri ][ od ][  ][ of application of the brakes) a gravitational field which is directed ][  ][ forwa
rds and which is variable with respe ][ ct to time. Under the ][  ][ influence of this field, the embankment together with the e
arth moves ][  ][ non-uniformly in such  ][ a manner that their original velocity in the ][  ][ backwards direction is continuou
sly reduced." ][  ][ IN WHAT RESPECTS ARE TH ][ E FOUNDATIONS OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND OF THE ][  ][ SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIV
ITY UNSATISFACTORY? ][  ][ We have already state ][ d several times that classical mechanics starts ][  ][ out from the followin
g law: Material particles sufficiently far ][  ][ re ][ moved from other material particles continue to move uniformly in a ][  
][ straight line or continue in a state of rest. We have ][  also repeatedly ][  ][ emphasised that this fundamental law can onl
y be valid for bodies of ][  ][ reference K which possess ce ][ rtain unique states of motion, and which ][  ][ are in uniform t
ranslational motion relative to each other. Relative ][  ][ to o ][ ther reference-bodies K the law is not valid. Both in classi
cal ][  ][ mechanics and in the special theory of relativity we ther ][ efore ][  ][ differentiate between reference-bodies K re
lative to which the ][  ][ recognised " laws of nature " can be said to  ][ hold, and ][  ][ reference-bodies K relative to whic
h these laws do not hold. ][  ][ But no person whose mode of thought is logi ][ cal can rest satisfied with ][  ][ this conditio
n of things. He asks : " How does it come that certain ][  ][ reference-bodies ( ][ or their states of motion) are given priorit
y over ][  ][ other reference-bodies (or their states of motion) ? What is the ][  ] ][ [ reason for this Preference? In order t
o show clearly what I mean by ][  ][ this question, I shall make use of a comparison. ][ ][   ][ I am standing in front of a gas
 range. Standing alongside of each ][  ][ other on the range are two pans so much alike that ][  one may be mistaken ][  ][ for 
the other. Both are half full of water. I notice that steam is ][  ][ being emitted continuously ][  from the one pan, but not f
rom the other. I ][  ][ am surprised at this, even if I have never seen either a gas range or ][  ][ ][  a pan before. But if I 
now notice a luminous something of bluish ][  ][ colour under the first pan but not under the other, I c ][ ease to be ][  ][ as
tonished, even if I have never before seen a gas flame. For I can ][  ][ only say that this bluish something ][  will cause the 
emission of the ][  ][ steam, or at least possibly it may do so. If, however, I notice the ][  ][ bluish somethi ][ ng in neithe
r case, and if I observe that the one ][  ][ continuously emits steam whilst the other does not, then I shall ][  ][ ][  remain 
astonished and dissatisfied until I have discovered some ][  ][ circumstance to which I can attribute the different beha ][ viou
r of the ][  ][ two pans. ][  ][ Analogously, I seek in vain for a real something in classical ][  ][ mechanics (or in the s ][ 
pecial theory of relativity) to which I can ][  ][ attribute the different behaviour of bodies considered with respect to ][  ][
 ][  the reference systems K and K1.*  Newton saw this objection and ][  ][ attempted to invalidate it, but without success. But
 E.  ][ Mach recognsed ][  ][ it most clearly of all, and because of this objection he claimed that ][  ][ mechanics must be pla
ced on a ][  new basis. It can only be got rid of by ][  ][ means of a physics which is conformable to the general principle of 
][  ][ relat ][ ivity, since the equations of such a theory hold for every body ][  ][ of reference, whatever may be its state o
f motion. ][  ][ ][    Notes ][  ][ *) The objection is of importance more especially when the state of ][  ][ motion of the ref
erence-body is of su ][ ch a nature that it does not ][  ][ require any external agency for its maintenance, e.g. in the case wh
en ][  ][ the reference- ][ body is rotating uniformly. ][  ][ A FEW INFERENCES FROM THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ 
The considerations of Sectio ][ n 20 show that the general principle of ][  ][ relativity puts us in a position to derive proper
ties of the ][  ][ gravitational ][  field in a purely theoretical manner. Let us suppose, ][  ][ for instance, that we know the
 space-time " course " for any natur ][ al ][  ][ process whatsoever, as regards the manner in which it takes place in ][  ][ th
e Galileian domain relative to a Galilei ][ an body of reference K. By ][  ][ means of purely theoretical operations (i.e. simpl
y by calculation) we ][  ][ are then able to ][  find how this known natural process appears, as seen ][  ][ from a reference-bo
dy K1 which is accelerated relatively to K. But  ][ ][  ][ since a gravitational field exists with respect to this new body of ]
[  ][ reference K1, our consideration also teaches u ][ s how the gravitational ][  ][ field influences the process studied. ][ 
 ][ For example, we learn that a body which is in a stat ][ e of uniform ][  ][ rectilinear motion with respect to K (in accorda
nce with the law of ][  ][ Galilei) is executing an accelera ][ ted and in general curvilinear motion ][  ][ with respect to the
 accelerated reference-body K1 (chest). This ][  ][ acceleration ][  or curvature corresponds to the influence on the moving ][ 
 ][ body of the gravitational field prevailing relatively to K. It i ][ s ][  ][ known that a gravitational field influences the
 movement of bodies in ][  ][ this way, so that our consideration suppli ][ es us with nothing ][  ][ essentially new. ][  ][ Ho
wever, we obtain a new result of fundamental importance when we ][  ][ carry ][  out the analogous consideration for a ray of li
ght. With respect ][  ][ to the Galileian reference-body K, such a ray of light  ][ is transmitted ][  ][ rectilinearly with the
 velocity c. It can easily be shown that the ][  ][ path of the same ray of light is ][  no longer a straight line when we ][  ]
[ consider it with reference to the accelerated chest (reference-body ][  ][ K1). From t ][ his we conclude, that, in general, r
ays of light are ][  ][ propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields. In two respects th ][ is ][  ][ result is of great imp
ortance. ][  ][ In the first place, it can be compared with the reality. Although a ][  ][ detai ][ led examination of the quest
ion shows that the curvature of light ][  ][ rays required by the general theory of relativity is on ][ ly exceedingly ][  ][ sm
all for the gravitational fields at our disposal in practice, its ][  ][ estimated magnitude for light r ][ ays passing the sun 
at grazing ][  ][ incidence is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This ought to manifest ][  ][ itself in the  ][ following way. A
s seen from the earth, certain fixed ][  ][ stars appear to be in the neighbourhood of the sun, and are thus ][  ][  ][ capable 
of observation during a total eclipse of the sun. At such ][  ][ times, these stars ought to appear to be displaced  ][ outwards
 from the ][  ][ sun by an amount indicated above, as compared with their apparent ][  ][ position in the sky when the s ][ un i
s situated at another part of the ][  ][ heavens. The examination of the correctness or otherwise of this ][  ][ deduction i ][ 
s a problem of the greatest importance, the early solution ][  ][ of which is to be expected of astronomers.[2]* ][  ][ In the s
 ][ econd place our result shows that, according to the general ][  ][ theory of relativity, the law of the constancy of the vel
ocit ][ y of ][  ][ light in vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental ][  ][ assumptions in the special theory of rel
ativity  ][ and to which we have ][  ][ already frequently referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A ][  ][ curvature of 
rays of ligh ][ t can only take place when the velocity of ][  ][ propagation of light varies with position. Now we might think 
that as ][  ][ a ][  consequence of this, the special theory of relativity and with it ][  ][ the whole theory of relativity wou
ld be laid in the du ][ st. But in ][  ][ reality this is not the case. We can only conclude that the special ][  ][ theory of r
elativity cannot claim a ][ n unlinlited domain of validity ; ][  ][ its results hold only so long as we are able to disregard t
he ][  ][ influences of grav ][ itational fields on the phenomena (e.g. of light). ][  ][ Since it has often been contended by o
pponents of the theory of ][  ][ ][  relativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown by the ][  ][ general theory
 of relativity, it is perhaps advisa ][ ble to make the ][  ][ facts of the case clearer by means of an appropriate comparison. 
][  ][ Before the development of electro ][ dynamics the laws of electrostatics ][  ][ were looked upon as the laws of electrici
ty. At the present time we ][  ][ know that  ][ electric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic ][  ][ consideration
s only for the case, which is never strictly rea ][ lised, in ][  ][ which the electrical masses are quite at rest relatively to
 each ][  ][ other, and to the co-ordinate system. S ][ hould we be justified in saying ][  ][ that for this reason electrostati
cs is overthrown by the ][  ][ field-equations of Maxwel ][ l in electrodynamics ? Not in the least. ][  ][ Electrostatics is co
ntained in electrodynamics as a limiting case ; ][  ][ the l ][ aws of the latter lead directly to those of the former for the ]
[  ][ case in which the fields are invariable with regard to tim ][ e. No fairer ][  ][ destiny could be allotted to any physica
l theory, than that it should ][  ][ of itself point out the way to  ][ the introduction of a more ][  ][ comprehensive theory, 
in which it lives on as a limiting case. ][  ][ In the example of the tr ][ ansmission of light just dealt with, we have ][  ][ 
seen that the general theory of relativity enables us to derive ][  ][ theor ][ etically the influence of a gravitational field 
on the course of ][  ][ natural processes, the Iaws of which are already known w ][ hen a ][  ][ gravitational field is absent. 
But the most attractive problem, to the ][  ][ solution of which the general theory  ][ of relativity supplies the key, ][  ][ c
oncerns the investigation of the laws satisfied by the gravitational ][  ][ field itself ][ . Let us consider this for a moment.
 ][  ][ We are acquainted with space-time domains which behave (approximately) ][  ][ in a " ][  Galileian " fashion under suita
ble choice of reference-body, ][  ][ i.e. domains in which gravitational fields are absent. If w ][ e now refer ][  ][ such a do
main to a reference-body K1 possessing any kind of motion, ][  ][ then relative to K1 there exists a ][  gravitational field whi
ch is ][  ][ variable with respect to space and time.[3]**  The character of this ][  ][ field will of c ][ ourse depend on the 
motion chosen for K1. According to ][  ][ the general theory of relativity, the general law of the gravitati ][ onal ][  ][ fiel
d must be satisfied for all gravitational fields obtainable in ][  ][ this way. Even though by no means all grav ][ itationial f
ields can be ][  ][ produced in this way, yet we may entertain the hope that the general ][  ][ law of gravitation w ][ ill be d
erivable from such gravitational fields of ][  ][ a special kind. This hope has been realised in the most beautiful ][   ][ ][ m
anner. But between the clear vision of this goal and its actual ][  ][ realisation it was necessary to surmount a serious di ][ 
fficulty, and as ][  ][ this lies deep at the root of things, I dare not withhold it from the ][  ][ reader. We require to exten
 ][ d our ideas of the space-time continuum ][  ][ still farther. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) By means of the star photographs of t
wo e ][ xpeditions equipped by ][  ][ a Joint Committee of the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies, the ][  ][ existence of t

ix ][  ][ II ][ I.) ][  ][ **) This follows from a generalisation of the discussion in ][  ][ Section 20 ][  ][ BEHAVIOUR OF CLO
CKS AND MEASURIN ][ G-RODS ON A ROTATING BODY OF REFERENCE ][  ][ Hitherto I have purposely refrained from speaking about the ph
ysical ][  ][ interp ][ retation of space- and time-data in the case of the general ][  ][ theory of relativity. As a consequenc
e, I am guilty of a cert ][ ain ][  ][ slovenliness of treatment, which, as we know from the special theory ][  ][ of relativity
, is far from being unimport ][ ant and pardonable. It is now ][  ][ high time that we remedy this defect; but I would mention a
t the ][  ][ outset, that this m ][ atter lays no small claims on the patience and on ][  ][ the power of abstraction of the rea
der. ][  ][ We start off again from  ][ quite special cases, which we have frequently ][  ][ used before. Let us consider a spac
e time domain in which no ][  ][ gravita ][ tional field exists relative to a reference-body K whose state ][  ][ of motion has 
been suitably chosen. K is then a Galileian  ][ ][  ][ reference-body as regards the domain considered, and the results of ][  ]
[ the special theory of relativity hold relative ][  to K. Let us supposse ][  ][ the same domain referred to a second body of r
eference K1, which is ][  ][ rotating uniformly with ][  respect to K. In order to fix our ideas, we ][  ][ shall imagine K1 to 
be in the form of a plane circular disc, which ][  ][ ro ][ tates uniformly in its own plane about its centre. An observer who ]
[  ][ is sitting eccentrically on the disc K1 is sensible of ][  a force which ][  ][ acts outwards in a radial direction, and w
hich would be interpreted as ][  ][ an effect of inertia (centri ][ fugal force) by an observer who was at ][  ][ rest with resp
ect to the original reference-body K. But the observer ][  ][ on the ][  disc may regard his disc as a reference-body which is "
 at rest ][  ][ " ; on the basis of the general principle of relativity  ][ he is ][  ][ justified in doing this. The force acti
ng on himself, and in fact on ][  ][ all other bodies which are at rest rela ][ tive to the disc, he regards as ][  ][ the effec
t of a gravitational field. Nevertheless, the ][  ][ space-distribution of this  ][ gravitational field is of a kind that would 
][  ][ not be possible on Newton's theory of gravitation.* But since the ][  ][ obse ][ rver believes in the general theory of r
elativity, this does not ][  ][ disturb him; he is quite in the right when he believes t ][ hat a general ][  ][ law of gravitat
ion can be formulated- a law which not only explains ][  ][ the motion of the stars correctl ][ y, but also the field of force ]
[  ][ experienced by himself. ][  ][ The observer performs experiments on his circular disc with ][  clocks and ][  ][ measuring
-rods. In doing so, it is his intention to arrive at exact ][  ][ definitions for the signification  ][ of time- and space-data 
with ][  ][ reference to the circular disc K1, these definitions being based on ][  ][ his observations. ][  What will be his ex
perience in this enterprise ? ][  ][ To start with, he places one of two identically constructed clocks at ] ][ [  ][ the centre
 of the circular disc, and the other on the edge of the ][  ][ disc, so that they are at rest relative to it. We ][  now ask our
selves ][  ][ whether both clocks go at the same rate from the standpoint of the ][  ][ non-rotating Galileian refer ][ ence-bod
y K. As judged from this body, the ][  ][ clock at the centre of the disc has no velocity, whereas the clock at ][  ][ t ][ he e
dge of the disc is in motion relative to K in consequence of the ][  ][ rotation. According to a result obtained in Section  ][ 
12, it follows ][  ][ that the latter clock goes at a rate permanently slower than that of ][  ][ the clock at the centre of the
 ][  circular disc, i.e. as observed from K. ][  ][ It is obvious that the same effect would be noted by an observer whom ][  ][
 we  ][ will imagine sitting alongside his clock at the centre of the ][  ][ circular disc. Thus on our circular disc, or, to ma
ke the c ][ ase more ][  ][ general, in every gravitational field, a clock will go more quickly or ][  ][ less quickly, accordin
g to the pos ][ ition in which the clock is situated ][  ][ (at rest). For this reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable
 ][  ][ definiti ][ on of time with the aid of clocks which are arranged at rest ][  ][ with respect to the body of reference. A
 similar difficulty  ][ presents ][  ][ itself when we attempt to apply our earlier definition of simultaneity ][  ][ in such a 
case, but I do not wish  ][ to go any farther into this ][  ][ question. ][  ][ Moreover, at this stage the definition of the sp
ace co-ordinates also ][  ][ ][  presents insurmountable difficulties. If the observer applies his ][  ][ standard measuring-rod
 (a rod which is short as compar ][ ed with the ][  ][ radius of the disc) tangentially to the edge of the disc, then, as ][  ][
 judged from the Galileian system, t ][ he length of this rod will be less ][  ][ than I, since, according to Section 12, moving
 bodies suffer a ][  ][ shortening in th ][ e direction of the motion. On the other hand, the ][  ][ measaring-rod will not expe
rience a shortening in length, as judged ][  ][  ][ from K, if it is applied to the disc in the direction of the radius. ][  ][ 
If, then, the observer first measures the circum ][ ference of the disc ][  ][ with his measuring-rod and then the diameter of t
he disc, on dividing ][  ][ the one by the other, he ][  will not obtain as quotient the familiar ][  ][ number p = 3.14 . . ., 
but a larger number,[4]** whereas of course, ][  ][ for  ][ a disc which is at rest with respect to K, this operation would ][  
][ yield p exactly. This proves that the propositions of Euc ][ lidean ][  ][ geometry cannot hold exactly on the rotating disc,
 nor in general in a ][  ][ gravitational field, at least if we  ][ attribute the length I to the rod ][  ][ in all positions an
d in every orientation. Hence the idea of a ][  ][ straight line als ][ o loses its meaning. We are therefore not in a ][  ][ po
sition to define exactly the co-ordinates x, y, z relative to the ][  ][ ][  disc by means of the method used in discussing the 
special theory, and ][  ][ as long as the co- ordinates and times of events  ][ have not been ][  ][ defined, we cannot assign a
n exact meaning to the natural laws in ][  ][ which these occur. ][  ][ Thus all ][  our previous conclusions based on general r
elativity would ][  ][ appear to be called in question. In reality we must make a su ][ btle ][  ][ detour in order to be able t
o apply the postulate of general ][  ][ relativity exactly. I shall prepare the reader f ][ or this in the ][  ][ following para
graphs. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) The field disappears at the centre of the disc and increase ][ s ][  ][ proportionally to the d
istance from the centre as we proceed outwards. ][  ][ **) Throughout this consideration we have ][  to use the Galileian ][  ][
 (non-rotating) system K as reference-body, since we may only assume ][  ][ the validity of the resu ][ lts of the special theor
y of relativity ][  ][ relative to K (relative to K1 a gravitational field prevails). ][  ][ EUCLIDEAN A ][ ND NON-EUCLIDEAN CON
TINUUM ][  ][ The surface of a marble table is spread out in front of me. I can get ][  ][ from any one poin ][ t on this table 
to any other point by passing ][  ][ continuously from one point to a " neighbouring " one, and repeating ][  ][ ][  this proces
s a (large) number of times, or, in other words, by going ][  ][ from point to point without executing "jumps." I am ][  sure th
e reader ][  ][ will appreciate with sufficient clearness what I mean here by " ][  ][ neighbouring " and by " jumps " ( ][ if h
e is not too pedantic). We ][  ][ express this property of the surface by describing the latter as a ][  ][ continuum. ][  ] ][ 
[ Let us now imagine that a large number of little rods of equal length ][  ][ have been made, their lengths being small compare
 ][ d with the dimensions ][  ][ of the marble slab. When I say they are of equal length, I mean that ][  ][ one can be laid on 
any  ][ other without the ends overlapping. We next lay ][  ][ four of these little rods on the marble slab so that they constit
ute a ][ ][   ][ quadrilateral figure (a square), the diagonals of which are equally ][  ][ long. To ensure the equality of the 
diagonals, w ][ e make use of a little ][  ][ testing-rod. To this square we add similar ones, each of which has one ][  ][ rod 
in common with t ][ he first. We proceed in like manner with each of ][  ][ these squares until finally the whole marble slab is
 laid out with ][  ] ][ [ squares. The arrangement is such, that each side of a square belongs ][  ][ to two squares and each co
rner to four squares. ][ ][   ][ It is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this business without ][  ][ getting into the gr
eatest difficulties. We only ][  need to think of the ][  ][ following. If at any moment three squares meet at a corner, then tw
o ][  ][ sides of the fourth squ ][ are are already laid, and, as a consequence, ][  ][ the arrangement of the remaining two sid
es of the square is already ][  ][ c ][ ompletely determined. But I am now no longer able to adjust the ][  ][ quadrilateral so 
that its diagonals may be equal. If they ][  are equal of ][  ][ their own accord, then this is an especial favour of the marble
 slab ][  ][ and of the little rods, about w ][ hich I can only be thankfully ][  ][ surprised. We must experience many such sur
prises if the construction ][  ][ is to be succe ][ ssful. ][  ][ If everything has really gone smoothly, then I say that the po
ints of ][  ][ the marble slab constitute a Euclidea ][ n continuum with respect to the ][  ][ little rod, which has been used a
s a " distance " (line-interval). By ][  ][ choosing one ][  corner of a square as " origin" I can characterise every ][  ][ oth
er corner of a square with reference to this origin by means ][  of two ][  ][ numbers. I only need state how many rods I must p
ass over when, ][  ][ starting from the origin, I proceed toward ][ s the " right " and then " ][  ][ upwards," in order to arri
ve at the corner of the square under ][  ][ consideration. These two ][  numbers are then the " Cartesian co-ordinates ][  ][ " 
of this corner with reference to the " Cartesian co-ordinate system" ][  ][  ][ which is determined by the arrangement of little
 rods. ][  ][ By making use of the following modification of this abstract ] ][ [  ][ experiment, we recognise that there must a
lso be cases in which the ][  ][ experiment would be unsuccessful. We shall supp ][ ose that the rods " ][  ][ expand " by in am
ount proportional to the increase of temperature. We ][  ][ heat the central part of ][  the marble slab, but not the periphery,
 in ][  ][ which case two of our little rods can still be brought into ][  ][ coincidenc ][ e at every position on the table. Bu
t our construction of ][  ][ squares must necessarily come into disorder during the heating, ][  ][  ][ because the little rods 
on the central region of the table expand, ][  ][ whereas those on the outer part do not. ][  ][ ][  With reference to our littl
e rods -- defined as unit lengths -- the ][  ][ marble slab is no longer a Euclidean continuum, and  ][ we are also no ][  ][ lo
nger in the position of defining Cartesian co-ordinates directly ][  ][ with their aid, since the above  ][ construction can no 
longer be carried ][  ][ out. But since there are other things which are not influenced in a ][  ][ similar  ][ manner to the li
ttle rods (or perhaps not at all) by the ][  ][ temperature of the table, it is possible quite naturally to main ][ tain ][  ][ 
the point of view that the marble slab is a " Euclidean continuum." ][  ][ This can be done in a satisfactory manner ][  by maki
ng a more subtle ][  ][ stipulation about the measurement or the comparison of lengths. ][  ][ But if rods of every kind ][  (i.
e. of every material) were to behave in ][  ][ the same way as regards the influence of temperature when they are on ][  ][  ][ 
the variably heated marble slab, and if we had no other means of ][  ][ detecting the effect of temperature than the geometrical
 ][  behaviour of ][  ][ our rods in experiments analogous to the one described above, then our ][  ][ best plan would be to ass
ign  ][ the distance one to two points on the ][  ][ slab, provided that the ends of one of our rods could be made to ][  ][ coi
ncide wi ][ th these two points ; for how else should we define the ][  ][ distance without our proceeding being in the highest 
measure gros ][ sly ][  ][ arbitrary ? The method of Cartesian coordinates must then be ][  ][ discarded, and replaced by anothe
r which does not ][  assume the validity ][  ][ of Euclidean geometry for rigid bodies.*  The reader will notice ][  ][ that the
 situation depicted  ][ here corresponds to the one brought about ][  ][ by the general postitlate of relativity (Section 23). ]
[  ][   Notes ][  ][ *)  ][ Mathematicians have been confronted with our problem in the ][  ][ following form. If we are given a
 surface (e.g. an ellipsoid) ][  in ][  ][ Euclidean three-dimensional space, then there exists for this surface ][  ][ a two-di
mensional geometry, just as much ][  as for a plane surface. Gauss ][  ][ undertook the task of treating this two-dimensional ge
ometry from ][  ][ first principles, ][  without making use of the fact that the surface ][  ][ belongs to a Euclidean continuum
 of three dimensions. If we imagine ][   ][ ][ constructions to be made with rigid rods in the surface (similar to ][  ][ that a
bove with the marble slab), we should find t ][ hat different laws ][  ][ hold for these from those resulting on the basis of Eu
clidean plane ][  ][ geometry. The surface is no ][ t a Euclidean continuum with respect to the ][  ][ rods, and we cannot defin
e Cartesian co-ordinates in the surface. ][  ][ Gaus ][ s indicated the principles according to which we can treat the ][  ][ ge
ometrical relationships in the surface, and thus pointed ][  out the way ][  ][ to the method of Riemman of treating multi-dimen
sional, non-Euclidean ][  ][ continuum. Thus it is that math ][ ematicians long ago solved the formal ][  ][ problems to which w
e are led by the general postulate of relativity. ][  ][ GAUSSIA ][ N CO-ORDINATES ][  ][ According to Gauss, this combined anal
ytical and geometrical mode of ][  ][ handling the problem can be ar ][ rived at in the following way. We ][  ][ imagine a syste
m of arbitrary curves (see Fig. 4) drawn on the surface ][  ][ of the ta ][ ble. These we designate as u-curves, and we indicate
 each of ][  ][ them by means of a number. The Curves u= 1, u= 2 and u= 3 ar ][ e drawn in ][  ][ the diagram. Between the curve
s u= 1 and u= 2 we must imagine an ][  ][ infinitely large number to be drawn, a ][ ll of which correspond to real ][  ][ number
s lying between 1 and 2. fig. 04 We have then a system of ][  ][ u-curves, and this  ][ "infinitely dense" system covers the who
le surface ][  ][ of the table. These u-curves must not intersect each other, and ][  ][ ][  through each point of the surface o
ne and only one curve must pass. ][  ][ Thus a perfectly definite value of u belongs to ever ][ y point on the ][  ][ surface of
 the marble slab. In like manner we imagine a system of ][  ][ v-curves drawn on the surface. Th ][ ese satisfy the same conditi
ons as ][  ][ the u-curves, they are provided with numbers in a corresponding ][  ][ manner, and the ][ y may likewise be of arb
itrary shape. It follows that a ][  ][ value of u and a value of v belong to every point on the surface  ][ of ][  ][ the table.
 We call these two numbers the co-ordinates of the surface ][  ][ of the table (Gaussian co-ordinates). For  ][ example, the poi
nt P in the ][  ][ diagram has the Gaussian co-ordinates u= 3, v= 1. Two neighbouring ][  ][ points P and P1 on  ][ the surface 
then correspond to the co-ordinates ][  ][                        P:       u,v ][  ][                        P1:     ][  u + du,
 v + dv, ][  ][ where du and dv signify very small numbers. In a similar manner we may ][  ][ indicate the distance (lin ][ e-in
terval) between P and P1, as measured ][  ][ with a little rod, by means of the very small number ds. Then ][  ][ according  ][ 
to Gauss we have ][  ][                 ds2 = g[11]du2 + 2g[12]dudv = g[22]dv2 ][  ][ where g[11], g[12], g[22], are magnitudes 
 ][ which depend in a perfectly ][  ][ definite way on u and v. The magnitudes g[11], g[12] and g[22], ][  ][ determine the beha
viou ][ r of the rods relative to the u-curves and ][  ][ v-curves, and thus also relative to the surface of the table. For the 
][  ][ c ][ ase in which the points of the surface considered form a Euclidean ][  ][ continuum with reference to the measuring-
rods, but on ][ ly in this case, ][  ][ it is possible to draw the u-curves and v-curves and to attach numbers ][  ][ to them, i
n such a manner, ][  that we simply have : ][  ][                            ds2 = du2 + dv2 ][  ][ Under these conditions, the 
u-curves and v-curve ][ s are straight lines ][  ][ in the sense of Euclidean geometry, and they are perpendicular to each ][  ]
[ other. Here the Gaussi ][ an coordinates are samply Cartesian ones. It is ][  ][ clear that Gauss co-ordinates are nothing mor
e than an association of ][  ][  ][ two sets of numbers with the points of the surface considered, of such ][  ][ a nature that 
numerical values differing very  ][ slightly from each other ][  ][ are associated with neighbouring points " in space." ][  ][ 
So far, these considerations hold fo ][ r a continuum of two dimensions. ][  ][ But the Gaussian method can be applied also to a
 continuum of three, ][  ][ four or more ][  dimensions. If, for instance, a continuum of four ][  ][ dimensions be supposed ava
ilable, we may represent it in the following ][  ][  ][ way. With every point of the continuum, we associate arbitrarily four ][
  ][ numbers, x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], which are  ][ known as " co-ordinates." ][  ][ Adjacent points correspond to adjacent valu
es of the coordinates. If a ][  ][ distance ds is as ][ sociated with the adjacent points P and P1, this ][  ][ distance being m
easurable and well defined from a physical point of ][   ][ ][ view, then the following formula holds: ][  ][ ds2 = g[11]dx[1]^2
 + 2g[12]dx[1]dx[2] . . . . g[44]dx[4]^2, ][  ][ where the m ][ agnitudes g[11], etc., have values which vary with the ][  ][ po
sition in the continuum. Only when the continuum is a Euclidean  ][ one ][  ][ is it possible to associate the co-ordinates x[1]
 . . x[4]. with the ][  ][ points of the continuum so that we have s ][ imply ][  ][ ds2 = dx[1]^2 + dx[2]^2 + dx[3]^2 + dx[4]^2
. ][  ][ In this case relations hold in the four-dimensional continuum w ][ hich ][  ][ are analogous to those holding in our th
ree-dimensional measurements. ][  ][ However, the Gauss treatment for ds2 wh ][ ich we have given above is not ][  ][ always pos
sible. It is only possible when sufficiently small regions ][  ][ of the continu ][ um under consideration may be regarded as Eu
clidean ][  ][ continua. For example, this obviously holds in the case of the marble ][  ][  ][ slab of the table and local vari
ation of temperature. The temperature ][  ][ is practically constant for a small part of ][  the slab, and thus the ][  ][ geome
trical behaviour of the rods is almost as it ought to be ][  ][ according to the rules of Eu ][ clidean geometry. Hence the impe
rfections ][  ][ of the construction of squares in the previous section do not show ][  ][ thems ][ elves clearly until this con
struction is extended over a ][  ][ considerable portion of the surface of the table. ][  ][ We can  ][ sum this up as follows: 
Gauss invented a method for the ][  ][ mathematical treatment of continua in general, in which " ][  ][  ][ size-relations " (" 
distances " between neighbouring points) are ][  ][ defined. To every point of a continuum are assigned as m ][ any numbers ][  
][ (Gaussian coordinates) as the continuum has dimensions. This is done ][  ][ in such a way, that only one mean ][ ing can be a
ttached to the ][  ][ assignment, and that numbers (Gaussian coordinates) which differ by an ][  ][ indefinitely sma ][ ll amoun
t are assigned to adjacent points. The ][  ][ Gaussian coordinate system is a logical generalisation of the ][  ][ Carte ][ sian
 co-ordinate system. It is also applicable to non-Euclidean ][  ][ continua, but only when, with respect to the defined "siz ][ 
e" or ][  ][ "distance," small parts of the continuum under consideration behave ][  ][ more nearly like a Euclidean system, the
 ][  smaller the part of the ][  ][ continuum under our notice. ][  ][ THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM OF THE SPEICAL THEORY OF RELATIV
ITY  ][ CONSIDERED AS A ][  ][ EUCLIDEAN CONTINUUM ][  ][ We are now in a position to formulate more exactly the idea of ][  ][ 
Minkowsk ][ i, which was only vaguely indicated in Section 17. In ][  ][ accordance with the special theory of relativity, certa
in co-ordina ][ te ][  ][ systems are given preference for the description of the ][  ][ four-dimensional, space-time continuum.
 We called these ][  " Galileian ][  ][ co-ordinate systems." For these systems, the four co-ordinates x, y, ][  ][ z, t, which 
determine an event o ][ r -- in other words, a point of the ][  ][ four-dimensional continuum -- are defined physically in a sim
ple ][  ][ manner, as se ][ t forth in detail in the first part of this book. For the ][  ][ transition from one Galileian syste
m to another, which is movin ][ g ][  ][ uniformly with reference to the first, the equations of the Lorentz ][  ][ transformati
on are valid. These last form th ][ e basis for the derivation ][  ][ of deductions from the special theory of relativity, and i
n themselves ][  ][ they are nothing ][  more than the expression of the universal validity of ][  ][ the law of transmission of
 light for all Galileian systems of ][   ][ ][ reference. ][  ][ Minkowski found that the Lorentz transformations satisfy the fo
llowing ][  ][ simple conditions. Let us con ][ sider two neighbouring events, the ][  ][ relative position of which in the four
-dimensional continuum is given ][  ][ with resp ][ ect to a Galileian reference-body K by the space co-ordinate ][  ][ differen
ces dx, dy, dz and the time-difference dt. With refe ][ rence to a ][  ][ second Galileian system we shall suppose that the corr
esponding ][  ][ differences for these two events are dx ][ 1, dy1, dz1, dt1. Then these ][  ][ magnitudes always fulfil the con
dition* ][  ][      dx2 + dy2 + dz2 - c^2dt2 = dx1 2 + dy1 2 ][  + dz1 2 - c^2dt1 2. ][  ][ The validity of the Lorentz transfor
mation follows from this ][  ][ condition. We can express this a ][ s follows: The magnitude ][  ][                    ds2 = dx2
 + dy2 + dz2 - c^2dt2, ][  ][ which belongs to two adjacent points o ][ f the four-dimensional ][  ][ space-time continuum, has 
the same value for all selected (Galileian) ][  ][ reference-bodies. If  ][ we replace x, y, z, sq. rt. -I . ct , by x[1], ][  ]
[ x[2], x[3], x[4], we also obtaill the result that ][  ][              ds2  ][ = dx[1]^2 + dx[2]^2 + dx[3]^2 + dx[4]^2. ][  ][ 
is independent of the choice of the body of reference. We call the ][  ][ magnit ][ ude ds the " distance " apart of the two eve
nts or ][  ][ four-dimensional points. ][  ][ Thus, if we choose as time-variable th ][ e imaginary variable sq. rt. -I ][  ][ .
 ct instead of the real quantity t, we can regard the space-time ][  ][ contintium -- ac ][ cordance with the special theory of 
relativity -- as a ][  ][ ", Euclidean " four-dimensional continuum, a result which follows  ][ from ][  ][ the considerations o
f the preceding section. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) Cf. Appendixes I and 2. The relations which ar ][ e derived ][  ][ there for t
he co-ordlnates themselves are valid also for co-ordinate ][  ][ differences, and thus also for co-o ][ rdinate differentials (i
ndefinitely ][  ][ small differences). ][  ][ THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF REALTIIV ][ TY IS NOT A ][  ][ E
CULIDEAN CONTINUUM ][  ][ In the first part of this book we were able to make use of space-time ][  ][ co-or ][ dinates which al
lowed of a simple and direct physical ][  ][ interpretation, and which, according to Section 26, can be regarded ][  ][  ][ as f
our-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. This was possible on the ][  ][ basis of the law of the constancy of the vel ][ ocity of
 tight. But ][  ][ according to Section 21 the general theory of relativity cannot ][  ][ retain this law. On the contra ][ ry, 
we arrived at the result that ][  ][ according to this latter theory the velocity of light must always ][  ][ depend on the  ][ 
co-ordinates when a gravitational field is present. In ][  ][ connection with a specific illustration in Section 23, we found ][
 ][   ][ that the presence of a gravitational field invalidates the definition ][  ][ of the coordinates and the ifine, which le
d us ][  to our objective in the ][  ][ special theory of relativity. ][  ][ In view of the resuIts of these considerations we a
re led t ][ o the ][  ][ conviction that, according to the general principle of relativity, the ][  ][ space-time continuum cann
ot be regard ][ ed as a Euclidean one, but that ][  ][ here we have the general case, corresponding to the marble slab with ][  
][ local variati ][ ons of temperature, and with which we made acquaintance ][  ][ as an example of a two-dimensional continuum.
 Just as it was ther ][ e ][  ][ impossible to construct a Cartesian co-ordinate system from equal ][  ][ rods, so here it is im
possible to build up a s ][ ystem (reference-body) ][  ][ from rigid bodies and clocks, which shall be of such a nature that ][ 
 ][ measuring-rods and clock ][ s, arranged rigidly with respect to one ][  ][ another, shaIll indicate position and time direct
ly. Such was the ][  ][ essence  ][ of the difficulty with which we were confronted in Section ][  ][ 23. ][  ][ But the conside
rations of Sections 25 and 26 show u ][ s the way to ][  ][ surmount this difficulty. We refer the fourdimensional space-time ][
  ][ continuum in an arbitrary manner to ][  Gauss co-ordinates. We assign to ][  ][ every point of the continuum (event) four n
umbers, x[1], x[2], x[3], ][  ][ x[4] (co-or ][ dinates), which have not the least direct physical ][  ][ significance, but only
 serve the purpose of numbering the points of ][ ][   ][ the continuum in a definite but arbitrary manner. This arrangement ][  
][ does not even need to be of such a kind that we m ][ ust regard x[1], ][  ][ x[2], x[3], as "space" co-ordinates and x[4], as
 a " time " ][  ][ co-ordinate. ][  ][ The reader may th ][ ink that such a description of the world would be ][  ][ quite inade
quate. What does it mean to assign to an event the ][  ][ pa ][ rticular co-ordinates x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], if in themselves t
hese ][  ][ co-ordinates have no significance ? More careful con ][ sideration shows, ][  ][ however, that this anxiety is unfou
nded. Let us consider, for ][  ][ instance, a material point with an ][ y kind of motion. If this point had ][  ][ only a moment
ary existence without duration, then it would to ][  ][ described in spa ][ ce-time by a single system of values x[1], x[2], x[3
], ][  ][ x[4]. Thus its permanent existence must be characterised by an ][  ][  ][ infinitely large number of such systems of v
alues, the co-ordinate ][  ][ values of which are so close together as to give c ][ ontinuity; ][  ][ corresponding to the mater
ial point, we thus have a (uni-dimensional) ][  ][ line in the four-dimensional cont ][ inuum. In the same way, any such ][  ][ 
lines in our continuum correspond to many points in motion. The only ][  ][ statements h ][ aving regard to these points which c
an claim a physical ][  ][ existence are in reality the statements about their encounters. I ][ n our ][  ][ mathematical treatm
ent, such an encounter is expressed in the fact ][  ][ that the two lines which represent the mo ][ tions of the points in ][  ]
[ question have a particular system of co-ordinate values, x[1], x[2], ][  ][ x[3], x[4], in common. ][  After mature considerat
ion the reader will ][  ][ doubtless admit that in reality such encounters constitute the only ][  ][ ac ][ tual evidence of a t
ime-space nature with which we meet in physical ][  ][ statements. ][  ][ When we were describing the motion ][  of a material p
oint relative to a ][  ][ body of reference, we stated nothing more than the encounters of this ][  ][ point wit ][ h particular
 points of the reference-body. We can also ][  ][ determine the corresponding values of the time by the observation  ][ of ][  ]
[ encounters of the body with clocks, in conjunction with the ][  ][ observation of the encounter of the hands of clocks ][  wit
h particular ][  ][ points on the dials. It is just the same in the case of ][  ][ space-measurements by means of measuring- ][ 
rods, as a litttle ][  ][ consideration will show. ][  ][ The following statements hold generally : Every physical description ]
 ][ [  ][ resolves itself into a number of statements, each of which refers to ][  ][ the space-time coincidence of two events A
 and ][  B. In terms of Gaussian ][  ][ co-ordinates, every such statement is expressed by the agreement of ][  ][ their four co
-ordinat ][ es x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4]. Thus in reality, the ][  ][ description of the time-space continuum by means of Gauss co-
ordinates ][ ][   ][ completely replaces the description with the aid of a body of ][  ][ reference, without suffering from the 
defects of the l ][ atter mode of ][  ][ description; it is not tied down to the Euclidean character of the ][  ][ continuum whi
ch has to be represe ][ nted. ][  ][ EXACT FORMULATION OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ We are now in a position to
 replace the pro. vision ][ al formulation of ][  ][ the general principle of relativity given in Section 18 by an exact ][  ][ 
formulation. The form there  ][ used, "All bodies of reference K, K1, ][  ][ etc., are equivalent for the description of natural
 phenomena ][  ][ (formulation o ][ f the general laws of nature), whatever may be their ][  ][ state of motion," cannot be main
tained, because the use of rigid ][  ][  ][ reference-bodies, in the sense of the method followed in the special ][  ][ theory o
f relativity, is in general not possible ][  in space-time ][  ][ description. The Gauss co-ordinate system has to take the plac
e of the ][  ][ body of reference. The follo ][ wing statement corresponds to the ][  ][ fundamental idea of the general princip
le of relativity: "All Gaussian ][  ][ co-ordina ][ te systems are essentially equivalent for the formulation of ][  ][ the gene
ral laws of nature." ][  ][ We can state this genera ][ l principle of relativity in still another ][  ][ form, which renders it
 yet more clearly intelligible than it is when ][  ][ in ][  the form of the natural extension of the special principle of ][  ]
[ relativity. According to the special theory of relativity, ][  the ][  ][ equations which express the general laws of nature p
ass over into ][  ][ equations of the same form when, by making  ][ use of the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation, we replace the spa
ce-time variables x, y, z, t, of a ][  ][ (Galileian) reference-body ][  K by the space-time variables x1, y1, z1, ][  ][ t1, of
 a new reference-body K1. According to the general theory of ][  ][ rela ][ tivity, on the other hand, by application of arbitra
ry ][  ][ substitutions of the Gauss variables x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], the ] ][ [  ][ equations must pass over into equations of
 the same form; for every ][  ][ transformation (not only the Lorentz transforma ][ tion) corresponds to ][  ][ the transition o
f one Gauss co-ordinate system into another. ][  ][ If we desire to adhere to our "o ][ ld-time" three-dimensional view of ][  ]
[ things, then we can characterise the development which is being ][  ][ undergone by th ][ e fundamental idea of the general th
eory of relativity ][  ][ as follows : The special theory of relativity has reference to ][  ][  ][ Galileian domains, i.e. to t
hose in which no gravitational field ][  ][ exists. In this connection a Galileian reference-bod ][ y serves as body ][  ][ of r
eference, i.e. a rigid body the state of motion of which is so ][  ][ chosen that the Galileian law  ][ of the uniform rectiline
ar motion of ][  ][ "isolated" material points holds relatively to it. ][  ][ Certain considerations sug ][ gest that we should 
refer the same Galileian ][  ][ domains to non-Galileian reference-bodies also. A gravitational field ][  ][ ][  of a special ki
nd is then present with respect to these bodies (cf. ][  ][ Sections 20 and 23). ][  ][ In gravitational fields  ][ there are no
 such things as rigid bodies with ][  ][ Euclidean properties; thus the fictitious rigid body of reference is ][  ][ ][  of no a
vail in the general theory of relativity. The motion of clocks ][  ][ is also influenced by gravitational fields, and in ][  suc
h a way that a ][  ][ physical definition of time which is made directly with the aid of ][  ][ clocks has by no means the s ][ 
ame degree of plausibility as in the ][  ][ special theory of relativity. ][  ][ For this reason non-rigid reference-bodies are 
 ][ used, which are as a ][  ][ whole not only moving in any way whatsoever, but which also suffer ][  ][ alterations in form ad
 lib ][ . during their motion. Clocks, for which the ][  ][ law of motion is of any kind, however irregular, serve for the ][  ]
[ defini ][ tion of time. We have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a ][  ][ point on the non-rigid reference-body. These
 clocks sati ][ sfy only the ][  ][ one condition, that the "readings" which are observed simultaneously ][  ][ on adjacent cloc
ks (in space) di ][ ffer from each other by an ][  ][ indefinitely small amount. This non-rigid reference-body, which might ][  
][ appropriately be  ][ termed a "reference-mollusc", is in the main ][  ][ equivalent to a Gaussian four-dimensional co-ordinat
e system chosen ][  ][ a ][ rbitrarily. That which gives the "mollusc" a certain ][  ][ comprehensibility as compared with the G
auss co-ordinate system is t ][ he ][  ][ (really unjustified) formal retention of the separate existence of the ][  ][ space co
-ordinates as opposed to the tim ][ e co-ordinate. Every point on ][  ][ the mollusc is treated as a space-point, and every mate
rial point ][  ][ which is at rest r ][ elatively to it as at rest, so long as the mollusc ][  ][ is considered as reference-bod
y. The general principle of relativity ] ][ [  ][ requires that all these molluscs can be used as reference-bodies with ][  ][ e
qual right and equal success in the formulat ][ ion of the general laws ][  ][ of nature; the laws themselves must be quite inde
pendent of the choice ][  ][ of mollusc. ][  ][  ][ The great power possessed by the general principle of relativity lies ][  ][
 in the comprehensive limitation which is imposed on ][  the laws of nature ][  ][ in consequence of what we have seen above. ][
  ][ THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF GRAVITATION ON THE B ][ ASIS OF THE GENERAL ][  ][ PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ If the rea
der has followed all our previous considerations, he will ][ ][   ][ have no further difficulty in understanding the methods lea
ding to the ][  ][ solution of the problem of gravitation. ][  ] ][ [ We start off on a consideration of a Galileian domain, i.e
. a domain ][  ][ in which there is no gravitational field relative  ][ to the Galileian ][  ][ reference-body K. The behaviour 
of measuring-rods and clocks with ][  ][ reference to K is known from th ][ e special theory of relativity, ][  ][ likewise the 
behaviour of "isolated" material points; the latter move ][  ][ uniformly an ][ d in straight lines. ][  ][ Now let us refer thi
s domain to a random Gauss coordinate system or to ][  ][ a "mollusc" as referen ][ ce-body K1. Then with respect to K1 there is
 a ][  ][ gravitational field G (of a particular kind). We learn the behaviour ][  ] ][ [ of measuring-rods and clocks and also 
of freely-moving material points ][  ][ with reference to K1 simply by mathematical tran ][ sformation. We ][  ][ interpret this
 behaviour as the behaviour of measuring-rods, docks and ][  ][ material points tinder the i ][ nfluence of the gravitational fi
eld G. ][  ][ Hereupon we introduce a hypothesis: that the influence of the ][  ][ gravitational ][  field on measuringrods, clo
cks and freely-moving ][  ][ material points continues to take place according to the same laws, ][  ][  ][ even in the case whe
re the prevailing gravitational field is not ][  ][ derivable from the Galfleian special care, simply by ][  means of a ][  ][ t
ransformation of co-ordinates. ][  ][ The next step is to investigate the space-time behaviour of the ][  ][ ][  gravitational f
ield G, which was derived from the Galileian special ][  ][ case simply by transformation of the coordinates. Th ][ is behaviour
 is ][  ][ formulated in a law, which is always valid, no matter how the ][  ][ reference-body (mollusc) used in the ][  descrip
tion may be chosen. ][  ][ This law is not yet the general law of the gravitational field, since ][  ][ the gravitationa ][ l fi
eld under consideration is of a special kind. In ][  ][ order to find out the general law-of-field of gravitation we still ] ][ 
[  ][ require to obtain a generalisation of the law as found above. This can ][  ][ be obtained without caprice, however, by tak
 ][ ing into consideration the ][  ][ following demands: ][  ][ (a) The required generalisation must likewise satisfy the genera
l ][ ][   ][ postulate of relativity. ][  ][ (b) If there is any matter in the domain under consideration, only its ][  ][ inert
ial mass ][ , and thus according to Section 15 only its energy is ][  ][ of importance for its etfect in exciting a field. ][  ]
[ (c) Gravit ][ ational field and matter together must satisfy the law of ][  ][ the conservation of energy (and of impulse). ][
  ][ Finally, th ][ e general principle of relativity permits us to determine ][  ][ the influence of the gravitational field on
 the course of all t ][ hose ][  ][ processes which take place according to known laws when a ][  ][ gravitational field is abse
nt i.e. which have alrea ][ dy been fitted into ][  ][ the frame of the special theory of relativity. In this connection we ][  
][ proceed in principle acco ][ rding to the method which has already been ][  ][ explained for measuring-rods, clocks and freel
y moving material ][  ][ points. ][  ][  ][ The theory of gravitation derived in this way from the general ][  ][ postulate of r
elativity excels not only in its bea ][ uty ; nor in ][  ][ removing the defect attaching to classical mechanics which was broug
ht ][  ][ to light in Section 21; nor in ][  interpreting the empirical law of ][  ][ the equality of inertial and gravitational
 mass ; but it has also ][  ][ already expla ][ ined a result of observation in astronomy, against which ][  ][ classical mechan
ics is powerless. ][  ][ If we confine the appli ][ cation of the theory to the case where the ][  ][ gravitational fields can b
e regarded as being weak, and in which all ][  ][ ma ][ sses move with respect to the coordinate system with velocities ][  ][ w
hich are small compared with the velocity of light, we t ][ hen obtain as ][  ][ a first approximation the Newtonian theory. Thu
s the latter theory is ][  ][ obtained here without any part ][ icular assumption, whereas Newton had to ][  ][ introduce the hy
pothesis that the force of attraction between mutually ][  ][ at ][ tracting material points is inversely proportional to the sq
uare of ][  ][ the distance between them. If we increase the accurac ][ y of the ][  ][ calculation, deviations from the theory 
of Newton make their ][  ][ appearance, practically all of which must ne ][ vertheless escape the test ][  ][ of observation owi
ng to their smallness. ][  ][ We must draw attention here to one of these de ][ viations. According to ][  ][ Newton's theory, a
 planet moves round the sun in an ellipse, which ][  ][ would permanently mainta ][ in its position with respect to the fixed ][
  ][ stars, if we could disregard the motion of the fixed stars themselves ][  ][ an ][ d the action of the other planets under 
consideration. Thus, if we ][  ][ correct the observed motion of the planets for these t ][ wo influences, ][  ][ and if Newton'
s theory be strictly correct, we ought to obtain for the ][  ][ orbit of the planet an ellip ][ se, which is fixed with referenc
e to the ][  ][ fixed stars. This deduction, which can be tested with great accuracy, ][  ][ has ][  been confirmed for all the 
planets save one, with the precision ][  ][ that is capable of being obtained by the delicacy of obs ][ ervation ][  ][ attainab
le at the present time. The sole exception is Mercury, the ][  ][ planet which lies nearest the sun. Sin ][ ce the time of Lever
rier, it has ][  ][ been known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit of Mercury, ][  ][ after it has b ][ een corrected fo
r the influences mentioned above, is not ][  ][ stationary with respect to the fixed stars, but that it rotates  ][ ][  ][ excee
dingly slowly in the plane of the orbit and in the sense of the ][  ][ orbital motion. The value obtained for this r ][ otary mo
vement of the ][  ][ orbital ellipse was 43 seconds of arc per century, an amount ensured ][  ][ to be correct to within ][  a f
ew seconds of arc. This effect can be ][  ][ explained by means of classical mechanics only on the assumption of ][  ][ hypo ][ 
theses which have little probability, and which were devised ][  ][ solely for this purponse. ][  ][ On the basis of the general
 ][  theory of relativity, it is found that the ][  ][ ellipse of every planet round the sun must necessarily rotate in the ][  
][ m ][ anner indicated above ; that for all the planets, with the exception ][  ][ of Mercury, this rotation is too small to be
 detecte ][ d with the ][  ][ delicacy of observation possible at the present time ; but that in the ][  ][ case of Mercury it m
ust amount t ][ o 43 seconds of arc per century, a ][  ][ result which is strictly in agreement with observation. ][  ][ Apart f
rom this one, it ][  has hitherto been possible to make only two ][  ][ deductions from the theory which admit of being tested b
y observation, ][  ] ][ [ to wit, the curvature of light rays by the gravitational field of the ][  ][ sun,*x and a displacement
 of the spectral lines o ][ f light reaching ][  ][ us from large stars, as compared with the corresponding lines for ][  ][ lig
ht produced in an analogous  ][ manner terrestrially (i.e. by the same ][  ][ kind of atom).**  These two deductions from the th
eory have both ][  ][ been confi ][ rmed. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) First observed by Eddington and others in 1919. (Cf. Appendix

E UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE ][  ][ COSMOLOGICA ][ L DIFFICULTIES OF NEWTON'S THEORY ][  ][ Part from the difficulty discussed in Secti
on 21, there is a second ][  ][ fundamental  ][ difficulty attending classical celestial mechanics, which, ][  ][ to the best of
 my knowledge, was first discussed in detail by  ][ the ][  ][ astronomer Seeliger. If we ponder over the question as to how the
 ][  ][ universe, considered as a whole, is to be re ][ garded, the first answer ][  ][ that suggests itself to us is surely thi
s: As regards space (and time) ][  ][ the universe is in ][ finite. There are stars everywhere, so that the ][  ][ density of ma
tter, although very variable in detail, is nevertheless ][   ][ ][ on the average everywhere the same. In other words: However f
ar we ][  ][ might travel through space, we should find everywhe ][ re an attenuated ][  ][ swarm of fixed stars of approrimatel
y the same kind and density. ][  ][ This view is not in harmony with ][  the theory of Newton. The latter ][  ][ theory rather r
equires that the universe should have a kind of centre ][  ][ in which t ][ he density of the stars is a maximum, and that as we
 proceed ][  ][ outwards from this centre the group-density of the stars sho ][ uld ][  ][ diminish, until finally, at great dis
tances, it is succeeded by an ][  ][ infinite region of emptiness. The stellar u ][ niverse ought to be a ][  ][ finite island i
n the infinite ocean of space.* ][  ][ This conception is in itself not very satisfa ][ ctory. It is still less ][  ][ satisfact
ory because it leads to the result that the light emitted by ][  ][ the stars and also i ][ ndividual stars of the stellar syste
m are ][  ][ perpetually passing out into infinite space, never to return, and ][  ][ withou ][ t ever again coming into interac
tion with other objects of ][  ][ nature. Such a finite material universe would be destined to b ][ ecome ][  ][ gradually but s
ystematically impoverished. ][  ][ In order to escape this dilemma, Seeliger suggested a modificatio ][ n of ][  ][ Newton's law
, in which he assumes that for great distances the force ][  ][ of attraction between two masses diminis ][ hes more rapidly tha
n would ][  ][ result from the inverse square law. In this way it is possible for the ][  ][ mean density of ][  matter to be co
nstant everywhere, even to infinity, ][  ][ without infinitely large gravitational fields being produced. We thu ][ s ][  ][ fre
e ourselves from the distasteful conception that the material ][  ][ universe ought to possess something of the natu ][ re of a 
centre. Of ][  ][ course we purchase our emancipation from the fundamental difficulties ][  ][ mentioned, at the cost of ][  a m
odification and complication of Newton's ][  ][ law which has neither empirical nor theoretical foundation. We can ][  ][ im ][ 
agine innumerable laws which would serve the same purpose, without ][  ][ our being able to state a reason why one of them is to
 ][  be preferred to ][  ][ the others ; for any one of these laws would be founded just as little ][  ][ on more general theore
tica ][ l principles as is the law of Newton. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) Proof -- According to the theory of Newton, the number of
 "lines  ][ ][  ][ of force" which come from infinity and terminate in a mass m is ][  ][ proportional to the mass m. If, on the
 average, th ][ e Mass density p[0] ][  ][ is constant throughout tithe universe, then a sphere of volume V will ][  ][ enclose 
the average man  ][ p[0]V. Thus the number of lines of force ][  ][ passing through the surface F of the sphere into its interio
r is ][  ][ proporti ][ onal to p[0] V. For unit area of the surface of the sphere the ][  ][ number of lines of force which ent
ers the sphere is thus p ][ roportional ][  ][ to p[0] V/F or to p[0]R. Hence the intensity of the field at the ][  ][ surface w
ould ultimately become infin ][ ite with increasing radius R of ][  ][ the sphere, which is impossible. ][  ][ THE POSSIBILITY O
F A "FINITE" AND YET "UNBOUNDED" ][  UNIVERSE ][  ][ But speculations on the structure of the universe also move in quite ][  ][
 another direction. The development  ][ of non-Euclidean geometry led to ][  ][ the recognition of the fact, that we can cast do
ubt on the ][  ][ infiniteness of our sp ][ ace without coming into conflict with the laws ][  ][ of thought or with experience 
(Riemann, Helmholtz). These questions ][  ][ ][  have already been treated in detail and with unsurpassable lucidity by ][  ][ H
elmholtz and Poincar, whereas I can only touch  ][ on them briefly here. ][  ][ In the first place, we imagine an existence in t
wo dimensional space. ][  ][ Flat beings with flat  ][ implements, and in particular flat rigid ][  ][ measuring-rods, are free 
to move in a plane. For them nothing exists ][  ][ outs ][ ide of this plane: that which they observe to happen to themselves ][
  ][ and to their flat " things " is the all-inclusive real ][ ity of their ][  ][ plane. In particular, the constructions of pl
ane Euclidean geometry ][  ][ can be carried out by means of th ][ e rods e.g. the lattice construction, ][  ][ considered in Se
ction 24. In contrast to ours, the universe of ][  ][ these beings  ][ is two-dimensional; but, like ours, it extends to ][  ][ 
infinity. In their universe there is room for an infinite number of ][  ][  ][ identical squares made up of rods, i.e. its volum
e (surface) is ][  ][ infinite. If these beings say their universe is " pla ][ ne," there is ][  ][ sense in the statement, beca
use they mean that they can perform the ][  ][ constructions of plane Euclidean ][  geometry with their rods. In this ][  ][ con
nection the individual rods always represent the same distance, ][  ][ independentl ][ y of their position. ][  ][ Let us consid
er now a second two-dimensional existence, but this time ][  ][ on a spherical surface  ][ instead of on a plane. The flat being
s with ][  ][ their measuring-rods and other objects fit exactly on this surface and ][  ][ ][  they are unable to leave it. The
ir whole universe of observation ][  ][ extends exclusively over the surface of the sphere. Are ][  these beings ][  ][ able to 
regard the geometry of their universe as being plane geometry ][  ][ and their rods withal as the r ][ ealisation of " distance 
" ? They cannot ][  ][ do this. For if they attempt to realise a straight line, they will ][  ][ obtain ][  a curve, which we " 
three-dimensional beings " designate as a ][  ][ great circle, i.e. a self-contained line of definite finit ][ e length, ][  ][ 
which can be measured up by means of a measuring-rod. Similarly, this ][  ][ universe has a finite area that ca ][ n be compared
 with the area, of a ][  ][ square constructed with rods. The great charm resulting from this ][  ][ consideration  ][ lies in t
he recognition of the fact that the universe of ][  ][ these beings is finite and yet has no limits. ][  ][ But the sph ][ erica
l-surface beings do not need to go on a world-tour in ][  ][ order to perceive that they are not living in a Euclidean univ ][ e
rse. ][  ][ They can convince themselves of this on every part of their " world," ][  ][ provided they do not use too small a p 
][ iece of it. Starting from a ][  ][ point, they draw " straight lines " (arcs of circles as judged in ][  ][ three dimensional
 sp ][ ace) of equal length in all directions. They will ][  ][ call the line joining the free ends of these lines a " circle." 
For a ] ][ [  ][ plane surface, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its ][  ][ diameter, both lengths being measured w
ith the sam ][ e rod, is, according ][  ][ to Euclidean geometry of the plane, equal to a constant value p, which ][  ][ is inde
pendent of the  ][ diameter of the circle. On their spherical ][  ][ surface our flat beings would find for this ratio the value
 ][  ][             ][              eq. 27: file eq27.gif ][  ][ i.e. a smaller value than p, the difference being the more ][  
][ considerable, the gr ][ eater is the radius of the circle in comparison ][  ][ with the radius R of the " world-sphere." By m
eans of this relation ][  ] ][ [ the spherical beings can determine the radius of their universe (" ][  ][ world "), even when o
nly a relatively small part of  ][ their worldsphere ][  ][ is available for their measurements. But if this part is very small 
][  ][ indeed, they will no longer  ][ be able to demonstrate that they are on a ][  ][ spherical " world " and not on a Euclide
an plane, for a small part of ][  ][ a  ][ spherical surface differs only slightly from a piece of a plane of ][  ][ the same si
ze. ][  ][ Thus if the spherical surface be ][ ings are living on a planet of which ][  ][ the solar system occupies only a negl
igibly small part of the ][  ][ spherical unive ][ rse, they have no means of determining whether they are ][  ][ living in a fi
nite or in an infinite universe, because the " piec ][ e of ][  ][ universe " to which they have access is in both cases practic
ally ][  ][ plane, or Euclidean. It follows directly fr ][ om this discussion, that ][  ][ for our sphere-beings the circumferen
ce of a circle first increases ][  ][ with the radius until ][  the " circumference of the universe " is ][  ][ reached, and tha
t it thenceforward gradually decreases to zero for ][  ][ still ][  further increasing values of the radius. During this process
 the ][  ][ area of the circle continues to increase more and more, ][  until finally ][  ][ it becomes equal to the total area 
of the whole " world-sphere." ][  ][ Perhaps the reader will wonder why ][  we have placed our " beings " on a ][  ][ sphere rat
her than on another closed surface. But this choice has its ][  ][ justific ][ ation in the fact that, of all closed surfaces, t
he sphere is ][  ][ unique in possessing the property that all points on it are ][  ][  ][ equivalent. I admit that the ratio of
 the circumference c of a circle ][  ][ to its radius r depends on r, but for a giv ][ en value of r it is the ][  ][ same for a
ll points of the " worldsphere "; in other words, the " ][  ][ world-sphere " is a " su ][ rface of constant curvature." ][  ][ 
To this two-dimensional sphere-universe there is a three-dimensional ][  ][ analogy, namely ][ , the three-dimensional spherical
 space which was ][  ][ discovered by Riemann. its points are likewise all equivalent. It ][  ] ][ [ possesses a finite volume, 
which is determined by its "radius" ][  ][ (2p2R3). Is it possible to imagine a spherical space? To ][  imagine a ][  ][ space m
eans nothing else than that we imagine an epitome of our " ][  ][ space " experience, i.e. of experienc ][ e that we can have in
 the ][  ][ movement of " rigid " bodies. In this sense we can imagine a spherical ][  ][ space. ][  ][ Sup ][ pose we draw line
s or stretch strings in all directions from a ][  ][ point, and mark off from each of these the distance r with ][  a ][  ][ mea
suring-rod. All the free end-points of these lengths lie on a ][  ][ spherical surface. We can specially measure up ][  the area
 (F) of this ][  ][ surface by means of a square made up of measuring-rods. If the ][  ][ universe is Euclidean, then F ][  = 4p
R2 ; if it is spherical, then F is ][  ][ always less than 4pR2. With increasing values of r, F increases from ][  ][ zero  ][ u
p to a maximum value which is determined by the " world-radius," ][  ][ but for still further increasing values of r, the area  
][ gradually ][  ][ diminishes to zero. At first, the straight lines which radiate from ][  ][ the starting point diverge farthe
r a ][ nd farther from one another, but ][  ][ later they approach each other, and finally they run together again at ][  ][ a "
counter ][ -point" to the starting point. Under such conditions they ][  ][ have traversed the whole spherical space. It is easi
ly seen tha ][ t the ][  ][ three-dimensional spherical space is quite analogous to the ][  ][ two-dimensional spherical surface
. It is finite  ][ (i.e. of finite ][  ][ volume), and has no bounds. ][  ][ It may be mentioned that there is yet another kind 
of curved space: "  ][ ][  ][ elliptical space." It can be regarded as a curved space in which the ][  ][ two " counter-points "
 are identical (indisti ][ nguishable from each ][  ][ other). An elliptical universe can thus be considered to some extent ][  
][ as a curved universe pos ][ sessing central symmetry. ][  ][ It follows from what has been said, that closed spaces without l
imits ][  ][ are conceivable. F ][ rom amongst these, the spherical space (and the ][  ][ elliptical) excels in its simplicity, 
since all points on it are ][  ][ e ][ quivalent. As a result of this discussion, a most interesting ][  ][ question arises for 
astronomers and physicists, and that is ][  whether ][  ][ the universe in which we live is infinite, or whether it is finite in
 ][  ][ the manner of the spherical univers ][ e. Our experience is far from being ][  ][ sufficient to enable us to answer this
 question. But the general ][  ][ theory of rel ][ ativity permits of our answering it with a moduate degree ][  ][ of certainty
, and in this connection the difficulty mentioned i ][ n ][  ][ Section 30 finds its solution. ][  ][ THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE ACC
ORDING TO THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ Accor ][ ding to the general theory of relativity, the geometrical ][  ][ prop
erties of space are not independent, but they are determine ][ d by ][  ][ matter. Thus we can draw conclusions about the geomet
rical structure ][  ][ of the universe only if we base our cons ][ iderations on the state of the ][  ][ matter as being somethi
ng that is known. We know from experience that, ][  ][ for a suitab ][ ly chosen co-ordinate system, the velocities of the stars
 ][  ][ are small as compared with the velocity of transmission of ligh ][ t. We ][  ][ can thus as a rough approximation arrive
 at a conclusion as to the ][  ][ nature of the universe as a whole, if we  ][ treat the matter as being at ][  ][ rest. ][  ][ 
We already know from our previous discussion that the behaviour of ][  ][ measu ][ ring-rods and clocks is influenced by gravita
tional fields, i.e. ][  ][ by the distribution of matter. This in itself is suffici ][ ent to exclude ][  ][ the possibility of 
the exact validity of Euclidean geometry in our ][  ][ universe. But it is conceivable  ][ that our universe differs only ][  ][
 slightly from a Euclidean one, and this notion seems all the more ][  ][ probable, since c ][ alculations show that the metrics
 of surrounding ][  ][ space is influenced only to an exceedingly small extent by masses even ] ][ [  ][ of the magnitude of our
 sun. We might imagine that, as regards ][  ][ geometry, our universe behaves analogously to a surf ][ ace which is ][  ][ irreg
ularly curved in its individual parts, but which nowhere departs ][  ][ appreciably from a plane: somet ][ hing like the rippled
 surface of a ][  ][ lake. Such a universe might fittingly be called a quasi-Euclidean ][  ][ universe. As  ][ regards its space
 it would be infinite. But calculation ][  ][ shows that in a quasi-Euclidean universe the average density of m ][ atter ][  ][ 
would necessarily be nil. Thus such a universe could not be inhabited ][  ][ by matter everywhere ; it would presen ][ t to us t
hat unsatisfactory ][  ][ picture which we portrayed in Section 30. ][  ][ If we are to have in the universe an average ][  dens
ity of matter which ][  ][ differs from zero, however small may be that difference, then the ][  ][ universe cannot be quas ][ i
-Euclidean. On the contrary, the results of ][  ][ calculation indicate that if matter be distributed uniformly, the ][  ][ uni 
][ verse would necessarily be spherical (or elliptical). Since in ][  ][ reality the detailed distribution of matter is not unif
orm ][ , the real ][  ][ universe will deviate in individual parts from the spherical, i.e. the ][  ][ universe will be quasi-sp
herical ][ . But it will be necessarily finite. ][  ][ In fact, the theory supplies us with a simple connection *  between ][  ]
[ the space ][ -expanse of the universe and the average density of matter in ][  ][ it. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) For the radius 
R of the univer ][ se we obtain the equation ][  ][                         eq. 28: file eq28.gif ][  ][ The use of the C.G.S. s
ystem in this equat ][ ion gives 2/k = 1^.08.10^27; ][  ][ p is the average density of the matter and k is a constant connected

 co-ordinate system K by the abscissa x ][  ][  ][ and the time t, and with respect to the system K1 by the abscissa x' ][  ][ a

1 relative to K, or the velocity ][  ][ (directed towards the negative x-axis) of a point of K with respect t ][ o ][  ][ K'. In
 short, we can designate v as the relative velocity of the two ][  ][ systems. ][  ][ Furthermore, the principle  ][ of relativi

n order ][  ][ to see how the points of the x-axis appear as viewed from K, we only ][  ][ require to take a " snapshot " of  ][
 K1 from K; this means that we have ][  ][ to insert a particular value of t (time of K), e.g. t = 0. For this ][  ][ value of t
  ][ we then obtain from the first of the equations (5) ][  ][                                x' = ax ][  ][ Two points of the x

            eq. 36: file  ][ eq36.gif ][  ][ But from what has been said, the two snapshots must be identical; ][  ][ hence Dx i
n (7) must be equal to Dx' in ][  (7a), so that we obtain ][  ][                         eq. 37: file eq37.gif ][  ][ The equati

Thus we have obtained the Lorentz transfo ][ rmation for events on the ][  ][ x-axis. It satisfies the condition ][  ][         
 x'2 - c^2t'2 = x2 - c^2t2    .     .     .   ][   (8a). ][  ][ The extension of this result, to include events which take place

                     eq. 39: file eq39.gif ][  ][ In  ][ this way we satisfy the postulate of the constancy of the velocity ][  
][ of light in vacuo for rays of light of arbitrary direc ][ tion, both for ][  ][ the system K and for the system K'. This may 
be shown in the following ][  ][ manner. ][  ][ We suppose a  ][ light-signal sent out from the origin of K at the time t ][  ][
 = 0. It will be propagated according to the equation ][  ][      ][                     eq. 40: file eq40.gif ][  ][ or, if we 
square this equation, according to the equation ][  ][           x2 + ][  y2 + z2 = c^2t2 = 0    .     .     .    (10). ][  ][ I
t is required by the law of propagation of light, in conjunction with ][  ][  ][ the postulate of relativity, that the transmiss

ormula ][  ][                                r' = ct' ][  ][ or, ][  ][        x' ][ 2 + y'2 + z'2 - c^2t'2 = 0    .     .     .
    (10a). ][  ][ In order that equation (10a) may be a consequence of equation (10), ][  we ][  ][ must have ][  ][    x'2 + y'
2 + z'2 - c^2t'2 = s (x2 + y2 + z2 - c^2t2)       (11). ][  ][ Since equation (8a) must h ][ old for points on the x-axis, we th
us have s ][  ][ = I. It is easily seen that the Lorentz transformation really ][  ][ satisfi ][ es equation (11) for s = I; for
 (11) is a consequence of (8a) ][  ][ and (9), and hence also of (8) and (9). We have thus derive ][ d the ][  ][ Lorentz transf
ormation. ][  ][ The Lorentz transformation represented by (8) and (9) still requires ][  ][ to be ge ][ neralised. Obviously it
 is immaterial whether the axes of K1 ][  ][ be chosen so that they are spatially parallel to those of K. ][  It is ][  ][ also 
not essential that the velocity of translation of K1 with respect ][  ][ to K should be in the direction of t ][ he x-axis. A si
mple consideration ][  ][ shows that we are able to construct the Lorentz transformation in this ][  ][ general s ][ ense from t
wo kinds of transformations, viz. from Lorentz ][  ][ transformations in the special sense and from purely spatial ][ ][   ][ tr
ansformations. which corresponds to the replacement of the ][  ][ rectangular co-ordinate system by a new system with its ][  ax
es pointing ][  ][ in other directions. ][  ][ Mathematically, we can characterise the generalised Lorentz ][  ][ transformat ][
 ion thus : ][  ][ It expresses x', y', x', t', in terms of linear homogeneous functions ][  ][ of x, y, x, t, of such a kind th
a ][ t the relation ][  ][      x'2 + y'2 + z'2 - c^2t'2 = x2 + y2 + z2 - c^2t2       (11a). ][  ][ is satisficd identically. Th
at is ][  to say: If we substitute their ][  ][ expressions in x, y, x, t, in place of x', y', x', t', on the ][  ][ left-hand s
ide, then ][  the left-hand side of (11a) agrees with the ][  ][ right-hand side. ][  ][ APPENDIX II ][  ][ MINKOWSKI'S FOUR-DIM
ENSIONAL SPAC ][ E ("WORLD") ][  ][ (SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION 17) ][  ][ We can characterise the Lorentz transformation still mo
re simply if we ] ][ [  ][ introduce the imaginary eq. 25 in place of t, as time-variable. If, in ][  ][ accordance with this, w
e insert ][  ][       ][                          x[1] = x ][  ][                               x[2] = y ][  ][                 
              x[3] = z ][ ][   ][                               x[4] = eq. 25 ][  ][ and similarly for the accented system K1, t
hen the condition which is ][ ][   ][ identically satisfied by the transformation can be expressed thus : ][  ][ x[1]'2 + x[2]'2
 + x[3]'2 + x[4]'2 = x[1]^2 + x[2 ][ ]^2 + x[3]^2 + x[4]^2 ][  ][     (12). ][  ][ That is, by the afore-mentioned choice of " c
oordinates," (11a) [see ][  ][ the en ][ d of Appendix II] is transformed into this equation. ][  ][ We see from (12) that the i
maginary time co-ordinate x[4], enters in ][ to ][  ][ the condition of transformation in exactly the same way as the space ][  
][ co-ordinates x[1], x[2], x[3]. It is due t ][ o this fact that, according ][  ][ to the theory of relativity, the " time "x[4
], enters into natural ][  ][ laws in the same fo ][ rm as the space co ordinates x[1], x[2], x[3]. ][  ][ A four-dimensional co
ntinuum described by the "co-ordinates" x[1], ][  ][  ][ x[2], x[3], x[4], was called "world" by Minkowski, who also termed a ][
  ][ point-event a " world-point." From a "happening" in  ][ three-dimensional ][  ][ space, physics becomes, as it were, an " e
xistence " in the ][  ][ four-dimensional " world." ][  ][ Th ][ is four-dimensional " world " bears a close similarity to the ]
[  ][ three-dimensional " space " of (Euclidean) analytical geome ][ try. If we ][  ][ introduce into the latter a new Cartesian
 co-ordinate system (x'[1], ][  ][ x'[2], x'[3]) with the same origin ][ , then x'[1], x'[2], x'[3], are ][  ][ linear homogeneo
us functions of x[1], x[2], x[3] which identically ][  ][ satisfy the equ ][ ation ][  ][         x'[1]^2 + x'[2]^2 + x'[3]^2 = 
x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 + x[3]^2 ][  ][ The analogy with (12) is a complete one. We c ][ an regard Minkowski's " ][  ][ world " in a for
mal manner as a four-dimensional Euclidean space (with ][  ][ an imaginary time c ][ oordinate) ; the Lorentz transformation cor
responds ][  ][ to a " rotation " of the co-ordinate system in the fourdimensional "  ][ ][  ][ world." ][  ][ APPENDIX III ][  
][ THE EXPERIMENTAL CONFIRMATION OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ From a system ][ atic theoretical point of view, we 
may imagine the ][  ][ process of evolution of an empirical science to be a continuous ][  ][ ][  process of induction. Theories
 are evolved and are expressed in short ][  ][ compass as statements of a large number of individ ][ ual observations in ][  ][ 
the form of empirical laws, from which the general laws can be ][  ][ ascertained by comparison. Rega ][ rded in this way, the d
evelopment of a ][  ][ science bears some resemblance to the compilation of a classified ][  ][ catalogue ][ . It is, as it were
, a purely empirical enterprise. ][  ][ But this point of view by no means embraces the whole of the actual ] ][ [  ][ process ;
 for it slurs over the important part played by intuition and ][  ][ deductive thought in the development of an e ][ xact scienc
e. As soon as a ][  ][ science has emerged from its initial stages, theoretical advances are ][  ][ no longer achieve ][ d merel
y by a process of arrangement. Guided by ][  ][ empirical data, the investigator rather develops a system of thought ][   ][ ][ 
which, in general, is built up logically from a small number of ][  ][ fundamental assumptions, the so-called axioms. We call ][
  such a system ][  ][ of thought a theory. The theory finds the justification for its ][  ][ existence in the fact that it corr
e ][ lates a large number of single ][  ][ observations, and it is just here that the " truth " of the theory ][  ][ lies. ][  ]
[ Cor ][ responding to the same complex of empirical data, there may be ][  ][ several theories, which differ from one another t
o a consi ][ derable ][  ][ extent. But as regards the deductions from the theories which are ][  ][ capable of being tested, th
e agreement b ][ etween the theories may be so ][  ][ complete that it becomes difficult to find any deductions in which the ][ 
 ][ two theories  ][ differ from each other. As an example, a case of general ][  ][ interest is available in the province of bi
ology, in the Darwini ][ an ][  ][ theory of the development of species by selection in the struggle for ][  ][ existence, and i
n the theory of developme ][ nt which is based on the ][  ][ hypothesis of the hereditary transmission of acquired characters. ]
[  ][ We have another instanc ][ e of far-reaching agreement between the ][  ][ deductions from two theories in Newtonian mechan
ics on the one hand, ][  ][ and t ][ he general theory of relativity on the other. This agreement goes ][  ][ so far, that up to
 the preseat we have been able to fin ][ d only a few ][  ][ deductions from the general theory of relativity which are capable 
of ][  ][ investigation, and to which the ][  physics of pre-relativity days does ][  ][ not also lead, and this despite the pro
found difference in the ][  ][ fundamental as ][ sumptions of the two theories. In what follows, we shall ][  ][ again consider 
these important deductions, and we shall also dis ][ cuss ][  ][ the empirical evidence appertaining to them which has hitherto 
been ][  ][ obtained. ][  ][  (a) Motion of the Perih ][ elion of Mercury ][  ][ According to Newtonian mechanics and Newton's l
aw of gravitation, a ][  ][ planet which is revolving rou ][ nd the sun would describe an ellipse ][  ][ round the latter, or, m
ore correctly, round the common centre of ][  ][ gravity of t ][ he sun and the planet. In such a system, the sun, or the ][  ][
 common centre of gravity, lies in one of the foci of the orbital ][  ][  ][ ellipse in such a manner that, in the course of a p
lanet-year, the ][  ][ distance sun-planet grows from a minimum to a  ][ maximum, and then ][  ][ decreases again to a minimum. 
If instead of Newton's law we insert a ][  ][ somewhat different law of a ][ ttraction into the calculation, we find ][  ][ that
, according to this new law, the motion would still take place in ][  ][ such ][  a manner that the distance sun-planet exhibits
 periodic ][  ][ variations; but in this case the angle described by the line joi ][ ning ][  ][ sun and planet during such a pe
riod (from perihelion--closest ][  ][ proximity to the sun--to perihelion) would diff ][ er from 360^0. The line ][  ][ of the o
rbit would not then be a closed one but in the course of time ][  ][ it would fill up an  ][ annular part of the orbital plane, 
viz. between ][  ][ the circle of least and the circle of greatest distance of the planet ][  ][  ][ from the sun. ][  ][ Accord
ing also to the general theory of relativity, which differs of ][  ][ course from the theory of N ][ ewton, a small variation fr
om the ][  ][ Newton-Kepler motion of a planet in its orbit should take place, and ][  ][ in such awa ][ y, that the angle descr
ibed by the radius sun-planet ][  ][ between one perhelion and the next should exceed that corresponding  ][ to ][  ][ one compl
ete revolution by an amount given by ][  ][                         eq. 41: file eq41.gif ][  ][ (N.B. -- One ][  complete revol
ution corresponds to the angle 2p in the ][  ][ absolute angular measure customary in physics, and the above ][   ][ ][ expressi
on giver the amount by which the radius sun-planet exceeds ][  ][ this angle during the interval between one periheli ][ on and 
the next.) ][  ][ In this expression a represents the major semi-axis of the ellipse, e ][  ][ its eccentricity, c the ve ][ loc
ity of light, and T the period of ][  ][ revolution of the planet. Our result may also be stated as follows : ][  ][ Accordin ][
 g to the general theory of relativity, the major axis of the ][  ][ ellipse rotates round the sun in the same sense as the orbi
t ][ al motion ][  ][ of the planet. Theory requires that this rotation should amount to 43 ][  ][ seconds of arc per century fo
r the ][  planet Mercury, but for the other ][  ][ Planets of our solar system its magnitude should be so small that it ][  ][ w
ould nece ][ ssarily escape detection. * ][  ][ In point of fact, astronomers have found that the theory of Newton ][  ][ does n
ot suffice to ][  calculate the observed motion of Mercury with an ][  ][ exactness corresponding to that of the delicacy of obs
ervation ][  ][ a ][ ttainable at the present time. After taking account of all the ][  ][ disturbing influences exerted on Merc
ury by the remaining  ][ planets, it ][  ][ was found (Leverrier: 1859; and Newcomb: 1895) that an unexplained ][  ][ perihelial
 movement of the orbit of ][  Mercury remained over, the amount ][  ][ of which does not differ sensibly from the above mentione
d +43 seconds ][  ][ of arc p ][ er century. The uncertainty of the empirical result amounts to ][  ][ a few seconds only. ][  ]
[  (b) Deflection of Light by a G ][ ravitational Field ][  ][ In Section 22 it has been already mentioned that according to the
 ][  ][ general theory of relativity, ][  a ray of light will experience a ][  ][ curvature of its path when passing through a g
ravitational field, this ][  ][ curvature ][  being similar to that experienced by the path of a body ][  ][ which is projected 
through a gravitational field. As a result of ][  this ][  ][ theory, we should expect that a ray of light which is passing clos
e to ][  ][ a heavenly body would be deviated tow ][ ards the latter. For a ray of ][  ][ light which passes the sun at a distan
ce of D sun-radii from its ][  ][ centre, the angle o ][ f deflection (a) should amount to ][  ][                         eq. 42
: file eq42.gif ][  ][ It may be added that, according to ][  the theory, half of Figure 05 this ][  ][ deflection is produced b
y the Newtonian field of attraction of the ][  ][ sun, and th ][ e other half by the geometrical modification (" curvature ][  ]
[ ") of space caused by the sun. ][  ][ This result admits of an  ][ experimental test by means of the ][  ][ photographic regis
tration of stars during a total eclipse of the sun. ][  ][ The only r ][ eason why we must wait for a total eclipse is because a
t ][  ][ every other time the atmosphere is so strongly illuminated by th ][ e ][  ][ light from the sun that the stars situated
 near the sun's disc are ][  ][ invisible. The predicted effect can be seen c ][ learly from the ][  ][ accompanying diagram. If
 the sun (S) were not present, a star which is ][  ][ practically infinitely dist ][ ant would be seen in the direction D[1], as
 ][  ][ observed front the earth. But as a consequence of the deflection of ][  ][ li ][ ght from the star by the sun, the star 
will be seen in the direction ][  ][ D[2], i.e. at a somewhat greater distance from the c ][ entre of the sun ][  ][ than corres
ponds to its real position. ][  ][ In practice, the question is tested in the following way.  ][ The stars in ][  ][ the neighbo
urhood of the sun are photographed during a solar eclipse. ][  ][ In addition, a second photograp ][ h of the same stars is take
n when the ][  ][ sun is situated at another position in the sky, i.e. a few months ][  ][ earlier or ][  later. As compared whh
 the standard photograph, the ][  ][ positions of the stars on the eclipse-photograph ought to appear ][  ][  ][ displaced radia
lly outwards (away from the centre of the sun) by an ][  ][ amount corresponding to the angle a. ][  ][ We ar ][ e indebted to t
he [British] Royal Society and to the Royal ][  ][ Astronomical Society for the investigation of this important ] ][ [  ][ deduc
tion. Undaunted by the [first world] war and by difficulties of ][  ][ both a material and a psychological nature aro ][ used by
 the war, these ][  ][ societies equipped two expeditions -- to Sobral (Brazil), and to the ][  ][ island of Principe (We ][ st 
Africa) -- and sent several of Britain's most ][  ][ celebrated astronomers (Eddington, Cottingham, Crommelin, Davidson), ][  ][
  ][ in order to obtain photographs of the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. ][  ][ The relative discrepancies to be expected bet
w ][ een the stellar ][  ][ photographs obtained during the eclipse and the comparison photographs ][  ][ amounted to a few hund
redth ][ s of a millimetre only. Thus great accuracy ][  ][ was necessary in making the adjustments required for the taking of t
he ][  ][ ][  photographs, and in their subsequent measurement. ][  ][ The results of the measurements confirmed the theory in a
 thoroughly ] ][ [  ][ satisfactory manner. The rectangular components of the observed and of ][  ][ the calculated deviations o
f the stars (in s ][ econds of arc) are set ][  ][ forth in the following table of results : ][  ][                       Table 
01: file table01.gif  ][ ][  ][  (c) Displacement of Spectral Lines Towards the Red ][  ][ In Section 23 it has been shown that 
in a system K1 which is i ][ n ][  ][ rotation with regard to a Galileian system K, clocks of identical ][  ][ construction, and
 which are considered at rest ][  with respect to the ][  ][ rotating reference-body, go at rates which are dependent on the ][ 
 ][ positions of the clocks. We s ][ hall now examine this dependence ][  ][ quantitatively. A clock, which is situated at a dis
tance r from the ][  ][ centre of the ][  disc, has a velocity relative to K which is given by ][  ][                           
      V = wr ][  ][ where w represents th ][ e angular velocity of rotation of the disc K1 ][  ][ with respect to K. If v[0], re

pect to the disc, ][  ][ will, in accordance with Sec ][ tion 12, be given by ][  ][                         eq. 43: file eq43.g
if ][  ][ or with sufficient accuracy by ][  ][           ][                eq. 44: file eq44.gif ][  ][ This expression may als

 to transport it ][  ][ from the position of the clock on the rotating di ][ sc to the centre of ][  ][ the disc, then we have ]
[  ][                         eq. 46: file eq46.gif ][  ][ From this it follo ][ ws that ][  ][                         eq. 47:

o at different rates when situated at ][  ][ different distances from the centre of t ][ he disc. This result is aiso ][  ][ val
id from the standpoint of an observer who is rotating with the ][  ][ disc. ][  ][ Now, a ][ s judged from the disc, the latter 
is in a gravititional field ][  ][ of potential f, hence the result we have obtained will hol ][ d quite ][  ][ generally for gr
avitational fields. Furthermore, we can regard an atom ][  ][ which is emitting spectral lines as ][  a clock, so that the follo
wing ][  ][ statement will hold: ][  ][ An atom absorbs or emits light of a frequency which is depend ][ ent on ][  ][ the poten
tial of the gravitational field in which it is situated. ][  ][ The frequency of an atom situated on the  ][ surface of a heaven
ly body ][  ][ will be somewhat less than the frequency of an atom of the same ][  ][ element which is situat ][ ed in free spac
e (or on the surface of a ][  ][ smaller celestial body). ][  ][ Now f = - K (M/r), where K is Newton's constant  ][ of gravitat
ion, and M ][  ][ is the mass of the heavenly body. Thus a displacement towards the red ][  ][ ought to take place fo ][ r spect
ral lines produced at the surface of ][  ][ stars as compared with the spectral lines of the same element produced ][  ][ ][  at
 the surface of the earth, the amount of this displacement being ][  ][                         eq. 48: file eq48.gif ][  ][  ][
 For the sun, the displacement towards the red predicted by theory ][  ][ amounts to about two millionths of the wave-length. A 
t ][ rustworthy ][  ][ calculation is not possible in the case of the stars, because in ][  ][ general neither the mass M nor th
e rad ][ ius r are known. ][  ][ It is an open question whether or not this effect exists, and at the ][  ][ present time (1920)
 astronom ][ ers are working with great zeal towards ][  ][ the solution. Owing to the smallness of the effect in the case of th
e ][  ][ sun, ][  it is difficult to form an opinion as to its existence. Whereas ][  ][ Grebe and Bachem (Bonn), as a result of
 their own measur ][ ements and ][  ][ those of Evershed and Schwarzschild on the cyanogen bands, have placed ][  ][ the existen
ce of the effect almo ][ st beyond doubt, while other ][  ][ investigators, particularly St. John, have been led to the opposite
 ][  ][ opinion in conseq ][ uence of their measurements. ][  ][ Mean displacements of lines towards the less refrangible end of
 the ][  ][ spectrum are cert ][ ainly revealed by statistical investigations of the ][  ][ fixed stars ; but up to the present 
the examination of the available  ][ ][  ][ data does not allow of any definite decision being arrived at, as to ][  ][ whether 
or not these displacements are to be  ][ referred in reality to ][  ][ the effect of gravitation. The results of observation hav

NDIX IV ][  ][ THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY  ][ ][  ][ (SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION 32) ][ 
 ][ Since the publication of the first edition of this little book, our ][  ][ knowledge ][  about the structure of space in the
 large (" cosmological ][  ][ problem ") has had an important development, which ought to be ][  ][  ][ mentioned even in a popu
lar presentation of the subject. ][  ][ My original considerations on the subject were based on  ][ two ][  ][ hypotheses: ][  ]
[ (1) There exists an average density of matter in the whole of space ][  ][ which is everywhere the ][  same and different from
 zero. ][  ][ (2) The magnitude (" radius ") of space is independent of time. ][  ][ Both these hypothes ][ es proved to be cons
istent, according to the ][  ][ general theory of relativity, but only after a hypothetical term was ][  ][  ][ added to the fie
ld equations, a term which was not required by the ][  ][ theory as such nor did it seem natural from a theoreti ][ cal point of
 ][  ][ view (" cosmological term of the field equations "). ][  ][ Hypothesis (2) appeared unavoidable to me at the ][  time, s
ince I thought ][  ][ that one would get into bottomless speculations if one departed from ][  ][ it. ][  ][ However, al ][ read
y in the 'twenties, the Russian mathematician Friedman ][  ][ showed that a different hypothesis was natural from a purely ] ][ 
[  ][ theoretical point of view. He realized that it was possible to ][  ][ preserve hypothesis (1) without introducing the less
 ][  natural ][  ][ cosmological term into the field equations of gravitation, if one was ][  ][ ready to drop hypothesis (2). N
amel ][ y, the original field equations ][  ][ admit a solution in which the " world radius " depends on time ][  ][ (expanding 
space).  ][ In that sense one can say, according to Friedman, ][  ][ that the theory demands an expansion of space. ][  ][ A few
 years later ][  Hubble showed, by a special investigation of the ][  ][ extra-galactic nebulae (" milky ways "), that the spect
ral lines ][  ][ ][  emitted showed a red shift which increased regularly with the distance ][  ][ of the nebulae. This can be i
nterpreted in regard ][  to our present ][  ][ knowledge only in the sense of Doppler's principle, as an expansive ][  ][ motion
 of the system of stars  ][ in the large -- as required, according ][  ][ to Friedman, by the field equations of gravitation. Hu
bble's discovery ][  ][ can, ][  therefore, be considered to some extent as a confirmation of the ][  ][ theory. ][  ][ There do
es arise, however, a strange dif ][ ficulty. The interpretation of ][  ][ the galactic line-shift discovered by Hubble as an exp
ansion (which ][  ][ can hardly be d ][ oubted from a theoretical point of view), leads to an ][  ][ origin of this expansion wh
ich lies " only " about 10^9 years ago,  ][ ][  ][ while physical astronomy makes it appear likely that the development ][  ][ o
f individual stars and systems of stars take ][ s considerably longer. It ][  ][ is in no way known how this incongruity is to b
e overcome. ][  ][ I further want to rernark tha ][ t the theory of expanding space, together ][  ][ with the empirical data of 
astronomy, permit no decision to be reached ][  ][ a ][ bout the finite or infinite character of (three-dimensional) space, ][  
][ while the original " static " hypothesis of space yie ][ lded the closure ][  ][ (finiteness) of space. ][  ][ K = co-ordinat
e system ][  ][ x, y = two-dimensional co-ordinates ][  ][ x ][ , y, z = three-dimensional co-ordinates ][  ][ x, y, z, t = four
