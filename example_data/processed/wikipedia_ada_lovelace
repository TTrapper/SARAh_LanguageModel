Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writ
er, ][ chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. ][ S
he was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, ][ and published the first algorithm in
tended to be carried out by such a machine. ][ As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potenti
al of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.[2][3][4] ][ Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet Lo
rd Byron and his wife Anne Isabella "Annabella" Milbanke, Lady Wentworth.[5] ][ All of Byron's other children were born out of w
edlock to other women.[6] ][ Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later
. ][ He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, "Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my h
ouse and heart?".[7] ][ He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. ][ Her mother remained
 bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived 
insanity. ][ Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request.
 ][ She was often ill in her childhood. ][ Ada married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby
 becoming Countess of Lovelace. ][ Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew C
rosse, Sir David Brewster, ][ Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to fur
ther her education. ][ Ada described her approach as "poetical science"[8] and herself as an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)".[9] ][ 
When she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British math
ematician Charles Babbage, ][ also known as "the father of computers", and in particular, Babbage's work on the Analytical Engin
e. ][ Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville. ][ Between 1842 
and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the engine, ][ supplementing it with an elabo
rate set of notes, simply called Notes. ][ These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an
 algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. ][ Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. ][ She 
also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, ][ 
including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.[10] ][ Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions
 about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) ][ examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collabor
ative tool.[6] ][
