Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (n?e Byron; 10 December 1
815 ? 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer,
 ][ chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mec
hanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. ][ She 
was the first to recognise that the machine had applications bey
ond pure calculation, ][ and published the first algorithm inten
ded to be carried out by such a machine. ][ As a result, she is 
sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential 
of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.[2][3
][4] ][ Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord 
Byron and his wife Anne Isabella "Annabella" Milbanke, Lady Went
worth.[5] ][ All of Byron's other children were born out of wedl
ock to other women.[6] ][ Byron separated from his wife a month 
after Ada was born and left England forever four months later. ]
[ He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, "Is thy fac
e like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my hous
e and heart?".[7] ][ He died of disease in the Greek War of Inde
pendence when Ada was eight years old. ][ Her mother remained bi
tter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an 
effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived ins
anity. ][ Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron and was
, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request. ][
 She was often ill in her childhood. ][ Ada married William King
 in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby be
coming Countess of Lovelace. ][ Her educational and social explo
its brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Cros
se, Sir David Brewster, ][ Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday a
nd the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to furthe
r her education. ][ Ada described her approach as "poetical scie
nce"[8] and herself as an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)".[9] ][ Whe
n she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long
 working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathema
tician Charles Babbage, ][ also known as "the father of computer
s", and in particular, Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. 
][ Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual fri
end, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville. ][ Between 1842 and
 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Lu
igi Menabrea on the engine, ][ supplementing it with an elaborat
e set of notes, simply called Notes. ][ These notes contain what
 many consider to be the first computer program?that is, an algo
rithm designed to be carried out by a machine. ][ Lovelace's not
es are important in the early history of computers. ][ She also 
developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond m
ere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, ][ inclu
ding Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.[10] ][
 Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions abou
t the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) ][ examining how
 individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative
 tool.[6] ][
