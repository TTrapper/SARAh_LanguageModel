s intended, as far as possible, to give an exact ][  ][ insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a ][  ]
[ general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in ][  ][ the theory, but who are not conversant with the m
athematical apparatus ][  ][ of theoretical physics. The work presumes a standard of education ][  ][ corresponding to that of a
 university matriculation examination, and, ][  ][ despite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force ][  ][
 of will on the part of the reader. The author has spared himself no ][  ][ pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in 
the simplest and ][  ][ most intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and ][  ][ connection in which they actually o
riginated. In the interest of ][  ][ clearness, it appeared to me inevitable that I should repeat myself ][  ][ frequently, with
out paying the slightest attention to the elegance of ][  ][ the presentation. I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that ][ 
 ][ brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom ][  ][ matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor an
d to the cobbler. ][  ][ I make no pretence of having withheld from the reader difficulties ][  ][ which are inherent to the sub
ject. On the other hand, I have purposely ][  ][ treated the empirical physical foundations of the theory in a ][  ][ "step-moth
erly" fashion, so that readers unfamiliar with physics may ][  ][ not feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the forest fo
r the ][  ][ trees. May the book bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive ][  ][ thought! ][  ][ December, 1916 ][  ][ A. 
EINSTEIN ][  ][ PART I ][  ][ THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ PHYSICAL MEANING OF GEOMETRICAL PROPOSITIONS ][  ][ In you
r schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance ][  ][ with the noble building of Euclid's geometry, and you remem
ber -- ][  ][ perhaps with more respect than love -- the magnificent structure, on ][  ][ the lofty staircase of which you were 
chased about for uncounted hours ][  ][ by conscientious teachers. By reason of our past experience, you would ][  ][ certainly 
regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the ][  ][ most out-of-the-way proposition of this science to be untrue. 
But ][  ][ perhaps this feeling of proud certainty would leave you immediately if ][  ][ some one were to ask you: "What, then, 
do you mean by the assertion ][  ][ that these propositions are true?" Let us proceed to give this ][  ][ question a little cons
ideration. ][  ][ Geometry sets out form certain conceptions such as "plane," "point," ][  ][ and "straight line," with which we
 are able to associate more or less ][  ][ definite ideas, and from certain simple propositions (axioms) which, ][  ][ in virtue
 of these ideas, we are inclined to accept as "true." Then, ][  ][ on the basis of a logical process, the justification of which
 we feel ][  ][ ourselves compelled to admit, all remaining propositions are shown to ][  ][ follow from those axioms, i.e. they
 are proven. A proposition is then ][  ][ correct ("true") when it has been derived in the recognised manner ][  ][ from the axi
oms. The question of "truth" of the individual geometrical ][  ][ propositions is thus reduced to one of the "truth" of the axio
ms. Now ][  ][ it has long been known that the last question is not only unanswerable ][  ][ by the methods of geometry, but tha
t it is in itself entirely without ][  ][ meaning. We cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line ][  ][ goes thro
ugh two points. We can only say that Euclidean geometry deals ][  ][ with things called "straight lines," to each of which is as
cribed the ][  ][ property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it. ][  ][ The concept "true" does not tally w
ith the assertions of pure ][  ][ geometry, because by the word "true" we are eventually in the habit of ][  ][ designating alwa
ys the correspondence with a "real" object; geometry, ][  ][ however, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved i
n ][  ][ it to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of ][  ][ these ideas among themselves. ][  ][ It is 
not difficult to understand why, in spite of this, we feel ][  ][ constrained to call the propositions of geometry "true." Geome
trical ][  ][ ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature, and these ][  ][ last are undoubtedly the exclusive caus
e of the genesis of those ][  ][ ideas. Geometry ought to refrain from such a course, in order to give ][  ][ to its structure t
he largest possible logical unity. The practice, for ][  ][ example, of seeing in a "distance" two marked positions on a ][  ][ 
practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in our ][  ][ habit of thought. We are accustomed further to regard t
hree points as ][  ][ being situated on a straight line, if their apparent positions can be ][  ][ made to coincide for observat
ion with one eye, under suitable choice ][  ][ of our place of observation. ][  ][ If, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we 
now supplement the ][  ][ propositions of Euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two ][  ][ points on a practically r
igid body always correspond to the same ][  ][ distance (line-interval), independently of any changes in position to ][  ][ whic
h we may subject the body, the propositions of Euclidean geometry ][  ][ then resolve themselves into propositions on the possib
le relative ][  ][ position of practically rigid bodies.* Geometry which has been ][  ][ supplemented in this way is then to be 
treated as a branch of physics. ][  ][ We can now legitimately ask as to the "truth" of geometrical ][  ][ propositions interpre
ted in this way, since we are justified in asking ][  ][ whether these propositions are satisfied for those real things we have 
][  ][ associated with the geometrical ideas. In less exact terms we can ][  ][ express this by saying that by the "truth" of a 
geometrical ][  ][ proposition in this sense we understand its validity for a ][  ][ construction with rule and compasses. ][  ]
[ Of course the conviction of the "truth" of geometrical propositions in ][  ][ this sense is founded exclusively on rather inco
mplete experience. For ][  ][ the present we shall assume the "truth" of the geometrical ][  ][ propositions, then at a later st
age (in the general theory of ][  ][ relativity) we shall see that this "truth" is limited, and we shall ][  ][ consider the ext
ent of its limitation. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) It follows that a natural object is associated also with a ][  ][ straight line.
 Three points A, B and C on a rigid body thus lie in a ][  ][ straight line when the points A and C being given, B is chosen suc
h ][  ][ that the sum of the distances AB and BC is as short as possible. This ][  ][ incomplete suggestion will suffice for the
 present purpose. ][  ][ THE SYSTEM OF CO-ORDINATES ][  ][ On the basis of the physical interpretation of distance which has bee
n ][  ][ indicated, we are also in a position to establish the distance between ][  ][ two points on a rigid body by means of me
asurements. For this purpose ][  ][ we require a " distance " (rod S) which is to be used once and for ][  ][ all, and which we 
employ as a standard measure. If, now, A and B are ][  ][ two points on a rigid body, we can construct the line joining them ][ 
 ][ according to the rules of geometry ; then, starting from A, we can ][  ][ mark off the distance S time after time until we r
each B. The number ][  ][ of these operations required is the numerical measure of the distance ][  ][ AB. This is the basis of 
all measurement of length. * ][  ][ Every description of the scene of an event or of the position of an ][  ][ object in space i
s based on the specification of the point on a rigid ][  ][ body (body of reference) with which that event or object coincides. 
][  ][ This applies not only to scientific description, but also to everyday ][  ][ life. If I analyse the place specification "
 Times Square, New York," ][  ][ **A I arrive at the following result. The earth is the rigid body ][  ][ to which the specifica
tion of place refers; " Times Square, New York," ][  ][ is a well-defined point, to which a name has been assigned, and with ][ 
 ][ which the event coincides in space.**B ][  ][ This primitive method of place specification deals only with places on ][  ][ 
the surface of rigid bodies, and is dependent on the existence of ][  ][ points on this surface which are distinguishable from e
ach other. But ][  ][ we can free ourselves from both of these limitations without altering ][  ][ the nature of our specificati
on of position. If, for instance, a cloud ][  ][ is hovering over Times Square, then we can determine its position ][  ][ relati
ve to the surface of the earth by erecting a pole ][  ][ perpendicularly on the Square, so that it reaches the cloud. The ][  ][
 length of the pole measured with the standard measuring-rod, combined ][  ][ with the specification of the position of the foot
 of the pole, ][  ][ supplies us with a complete place specification. On the basis of this ][  ][ illustration, we are able to s
ee the manner in which a refinement of ][  ][ the conception of position has been developed. ][  ][ (a) We imagine the rigid bod
y, to which the place specification is ][  ][ referred, supplemented in such a manner that the object whose position ][  ][ we r
equire is reached by. the completed rigid body. ][  ][ (b) In locating the position of the object, we make use of a number ][  ]
[ (here the length of the pole measured with the measuring-rod) instead ][  ][ of designated points of reference. ][  ][ (c) We 
speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole which ][  ][ reaches the cloud has not been erected. By means of optical ][ 
 ][ observations of the cloud from different positions on the ground, and ][  ][ taking into account the properties of the propa
gation of light, we ][  ][ determine the length of the pole we should have required in order to ][  ][ reach the cloud. ][  ][ F
rom this consideration we see that it will be advantageous if, in the ][  ][ description of position, it should be possible by m
eans of numerical ][  ][ measures to make ourselves independent of the existence of marked ][  ][ positions (possessing names) o
n the rigid body of reference. In the ][  ][ physics of measurement this is attained by the application of the ][  ][ Cartesian 
system of co-ordinates. ][  ][ This consists of three plane surfaces perpendicular to each other and ][  ][ rigidly attached to 
a rigid body. Referred to a system of ][  ][ co-ordinates, the scene of any event will be determined (for the main ][  ][ part) 
by the specification of the lengths of the three perpendiculars ][  ][ or co-ordinates (x, y, z) which can be dropped from the s
cene of the ][  ][ event to those three plane surfaces. The lengths of these three ][  ][ perpendiculars can be determined by a 
series of manipulations with ][  ][ rigid measuring-rods performed according to the rules and methods laid ][  ][ down by Euclid
ean geometry. ][  ][ In practice, the rigid surfaces which constitute the system of ][  ][ co-ordinates are generally not availa
ble ; furthermore, the magnitudes ][  ][ of the co-ordinates are not actually determined by constructions with ][  ][ rigid rods
, but by indirect means. If the results of physics and ][  ][ astronomy are to maintain their clearness, the physical meaning of
 ][  ][ specifications of position must always be sought in accordance with ][  ][ the above considerations. *** ][  ][ We thus 
obtain the following result: Every description of events in ][  ][ space involves the use of a rigid body to which such events h
ave to be ][  ][ referred. The resulting relationship takes for granted that the laws ][  ][ of Euclidean geometry hold for "dis
tances;" the "distance" being ][  ][ represented physically by means of the convention of two marks on a ][  ][ rigid body. ][  
][   Notes ][  ][ * Here we have assumed that there is nothing left over i.e. that ][  ][ the measurement gives a whole number. 
This difficulty is got over by ][  ][ the use of divided measuring-rods, the introduction of which does not ][  ][ demand any fu
ndamentally new method. ][  ][ **A Einstein used "Potsdamer Platz, Berlin" in the original text. ][  ][ In the authorised transl
ation this was supplemented with "Tranfalgar ][  ][ Square, London". We have changed this to "Times Square, New York", as ][  ][
 this is the most well known/identifiable location to English speakers ][  ][ in the present day. [Note by the janitor.] ][  ][ 
**B It is not necessary here to investigate further the significance ][  ][ of the expression "coincidence in space." This conce
ption is ][  ][ sufficiently obvious to ensure that differences of opinion are ][  ][ scarcely likely to arise as to its applica
bility in practice. ][  ][ *** A refinement and modification of these views does not become ][  ][ necessary until we come to de
al with the general theory of relativity, ][  ][ treated in the second part of this book. ][  ][ SPACE AND TIME IN CLASSICAL MEC
HANICS ][  ][ The purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their ][  ][ position in space with "time." I should loa
d my conscience with grave ][  ][ sins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were I to formulate the ][  ][ aims of mechanics in
 this way, without serious reflection and detailed ][  ][ explanations. Let us proceed to disclose these sins. ][  ][ It is not 
clear what is to be understood here by "position" and ][  ][ "space." I stand at the window of a railway carriage which is ][  ]
[ travelling uniformly, and drop a stone on the embankment, without ][  ][ throwing it. Then, disregarding the influence of the 
air resistance, I ][  ][ see the stone descend in a straight line. A pedestrian who observes ][  ][ the misdeed from the footpat
h notices that the stone falls to earth in ][  ][ a parabolic curve. I now ask: Do the "positions" traversed by the ][  ][ stone
 lie "in reality" on a straight line or on a parabola? Moreover, ][  ][ what is meant here by motion "in space" ? From the consi
derations of ][  ][ the previous section the answer is self-evident. In the first place we ][  ][ entirely shun the vague word "
space," of which, we must honestly ][  ][ acknowledge, we cannot form the slightest conception, and we replace ][  ][ it by "mot
ion relative to a practically rigid body of reference." The ][  ][ positions relative to the body of reference (railway carriage
 or ][  ][ embankment) have already been defined in detail in the preceding ][  ][ section. If instead of " body of reference " 
we insert " system of ][  ][ co-ordinates," which is a useful idea for mathematical description, we ][  ][ are in a position to 
say : The stone traverses a straight line ][  ][ relative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the carriage, ][  ][ b
ut relative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the ][  ][ ground (embankment) it describes a parabola. With the aid
 of this ][  ][ example it is clearly seen that there is no such thing as an ][  ][ independently existing trajectory (lit. "pat
h-curve"*), but only ][  ][ a trajectory relative to a particular body of reference. ][  ][ In order to have a complete descript
ion of the motion, we must specify ][  ][ how the body alters its position with time ; i.e. for every point on ][  ][ the trajec
tory it must be stated at what time the body is situated ][  ][ there. These data must be supplemented by such a definition of t
ime ][  ][ that, in virtue of this definition, these time-values can be regarded ][  ][ essentially as magnitudes (results of me
asurements) capable of ][  ][ observation. If we take our stand on the ground of classical ][  ][ mechanics, we can satisfy this
 requirement for our illustration in the ][  ][ following manner. We imagine two clocks of identical construction ; ][  ][ the m
an at the railway-carriage window is holding one of them, and the ][  ][ man on the footpath the other. Each of the observers de
termines the ][  ][ position on his own reference-body occupied by the stone at each tick ][  ][ of the clock he is holding in h
is hand. In this connection we have not ][  ][ taken account of the inaccuracy involved by the finiteness of the ][  ][ velocity
 of propagation of light. With this and with a second ][  ][ difficulty prevailing here we shall have to deal in detail later. ]
[  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) That is, a curve along which the body moves. ][  ][ THE GALILEIAN SYSTEM OF CO-ORDINATES ][  ][ As is we
ll known, the fundamental law of the mechanics of ][  ][ Galilei-Newton, which is known as the law of inertia, can be stated ][ 
 ][ thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a ][  ][ state of rest or of uniform motion in a straig
ht line. This law not ][  ][ only says something about the motion of the bodies, but it also ][  ][ indicates the reference-bodi
es or systems of coordinates, permissible ][  ][ in mechanics, which can be used in mechanical description. The visible ][  ][ f
ixed stars are bodies for which the law of inertia certainly holds to ][  ][ a high degree of approximation. Now if we use a sys
tem of co-ordinates ][  ][ which is rigidly attached to the earth, then, relative to this system, ][  ][ every fixed star descri
bes a circle of immense radius in the course of ][  ][ an astronomical day, a result which is opposed to the statement of the ][
  ][ law of inertia. So that if we adhere to this law we must refer these ][  ][ motions only to systems of coordinates relative
 to which the fixed ][  ][ stars do not move in a circle. A system of co-ordinates of which the ][  ][ state of motion is such t
hat the law of inertia holds relative to it ][  ][ is called a " Galileian system of co-ordinates." The laws of the ][  ][ mecha
nics of Galflei-Newton can be regarded as valid only for a ][  ][ Galileian system of co-ordinates. ][  ][ THE PRINCIPLE OF RELA
TIVITY ][  ][ (IN THE RESTRICTED SENSE) ][  ][ In order to attain the greatest possible clearness, let us return to ][  ][ our e
xample of the railway carriage supposed to be travelling ][  ][ uniformly. We call its motion a uniform translation ("uniform" b
ecause ][  ][ it is of constant velocity and direction, " translation " because ][  ][ although the carriage changes its positio
n relative to the embankment ][  ][ yet it does not rotate in so doing). Let us imagine a raven flying ][  ][ through the air in
 such a manner that its motion, as observed from the ][  ][ embankment, is uniform and in a straight line. If we were to observe
 ][  ][ the flying raven from the moving railway carriage. we should find that ][  ][ the motion of the raven would be one of di
fferent velocity and ][  ][ direction, but that it would still be uniform and in a straight line. ][  ][ Expressed in an abstrac
t manner we may say : If a mass m is moving ][  ][ uniformly in a straight line with respect to a co-ordinate system K, ][  ][ t
hen it will also be moving uniformly and in a straight line relative ][  ][ to a second co-ordinate system K1 provided that the 
latter is ][  ][ executing a uniform translatory motion with respect to K. In ][  ][ accordance with the discussion contained in
 the preceding section, it ][  ][ follows that: ][  ][ If K is a Galileian co-ordinate system. then every other co-ordinate ][  
][ system K' is a Galileian one, when, in relation to K, it is in a ][  ][ condition of uniform motion of translation. Relative 
to K1 the ][  ][ mechanical laws of Galilei-Newton hold good exactly as they do with ][  ][ respect to K. ][  ][ We advance a st
ep farther in our generalisation when we express the ][  ][ tenet thus: If, relative to K, K1 is a uniformly moving co-ordinate 
][  ][ system devoid of rotation, then natural phenomena run their course ][  ][ with respect to K1 according to exactly the sam
e general laws as with ][  ][ respect to K. This statement is called the principle of relativity (in ][  ][ the restricted sense
). ][  ][ As long as one was convinced that all natural phenomena were capable ][  ][ of representation with the help of classic
al mechanics, there was no ][  ][ need to doubt the validity of this principle of relativity. But in ][  ][ view of the more rec
ent development of electrodynamics and optics it ][  ][ became more and more evident that classical mechanics affords an ][  ][ 
insufficient foundation for the physical description of all natural ][  ][ phenomena. At this juncture the question of the valid
ity of the ][  ][ principle of relativity became ripe for discussion, and it did not ][  ][ appear impossible that the answer to
 this question might be in the ][  ][ negative. ][  ][ Nevertheless, there are two general facts which at the outset speak ][  ]
[ very much in favour of the validity of the principle of relativity. ][  ][ Even though classical mechanics does not supply us 
with a sufficiently ][  ][ broad basis for the theoretical presentation of all physical ][  ][ phenomena, still we must grant it
 a considerable measure of " truth," ][  ][ since it supplies us with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies ][  ][ with a de
licacy of detail little short of wonderful. The principle of ][  ][ relativity must therefore apply with great accuracy in the d
omain of ][  ][ mechanics. But that a principle of such broad generality should hold ][  ][ with such exactness in one domain of
 phenomena, and yet should be ][  ][ invalid for another, is a priori not very probable. ][  ][ We now proceed to the second arg
ument, to which, moreover, we shall ][  ][ return later. If the principle of relativity (in the restricted sense) ][  ][ does no
t hold, then the Galileian co-ordinate systems K, K1, K2, etc., ][  ][ which are moving uniformly relative to each other, will n
ot be ][  ][ equivalent for the description of natural phenomena. In this case we ][  ][ should be constrained to believe that n
atural laws are capable of ][  ][ being formulated in a particularly simple manner, and of course only ][  ][ on condition that,
 from amongst all possible Galileian co-ordinate ][  ][ systems, we should have chosen one (K[0]) of a particular state of ][  ]
[ motion as our body of reference. We should then be justified (because ][  ][ of its merits for the description of natural phen
omena) in calling ][  ][ this system " absolutely at rest," and all other Galileian systems K " ][  ][ in motion." If, for insta
nce, our embankment were the system K[0] then ][  ][ our railway carriage would be a system K, relative to which less ][  ][ sim
ple laws would hold than with respect to K[0]. This diminished ][  ][ simplicity would be due to the fact that the carriage K wo
uld be in ][  ][ motion (i.e."really")with respect to K[0]. In the general laws of ][  ][ nature which have been formulated with
 reference to K, the magnitude ][  ][ and direction of the velocity of the carriage would necessarily play a ][  ][ part. We sho
uld expect, for instance, that the note emitted by an ][  ][ organpipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of travel 
][  ][ would be different from that emitted if the axis of the pipe were ][  ][ placed perpendicular to this direction. ][  ][ N
ow in virtue of its motion in an orbit round the sun, our earth is ][  ][ comparable with a railway carriage travelling with a v
elocity of about ][  ][ 30 kilometres per second. If the principle of relativity were not ][  ][ valid we should therefore expec
t that the direction of motion of the ][  ][ earth at any moment would enter into the laws of nature, and also that ][  ][ physi
cal systems in their behaviour would be dependent on the ][  ][ orientation in space with respect to the earth. For owing to the
 ][  ][ alteration in direction of the velocity of revolution of the earth in ][  ][ the course of a year, the earth cannot be a
t rest relative to the ][  ][ hypothetical system K[0] throughout the whole year. However, the most ][  ][ careful observations 
have never revealed such anisotropic properties ][  ][ in terrestrial physical space, i.e. a physical non-equivalence of ][  ][ 
different directions. This is very powerful argument in favour of the ][  ][ principle of relativity. ][  ][ THE THEOREM OF THE 
][  ][ ADDITION OF VELOCITIES ][  ][ EMPLOYED IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS ][  ][ Let us suppose our old friend the railway carriage t
o be travelling ][  ][ along the rails with a constant velocity v, and that a man traverses ][  ][ the length of the carriage in
 the direction of travel with a velocity ][  ][ w. How quickly or, in other words, with what velocity W does the man ][  ][ adva
nce relative to the embankment during the process ? The only ][  ][ possible answer seems to result from the following considera
tion: If ][  ][ the man were to stand still for a second, he would advance relative to ][  ][ the embankment through a distance 
v equal numerically to the velocity ][  ][ of the carriage. As a consequence of his walking, however, he ][  ][ traverses an add
itional distance w relative to the carriage, and hence ][  ][ also relative to the embankment, in this second, the distance w be
ing ][  ][ numerically equal to the velocity with which he is walking. Thus in ][  ][ total be covers the distance W=v+w relativ
e to the embankment in the ][  ][ second considered. We shall see later that this result, which ][  ][ expresses the theorem of 
the addition of velocities employed in ][  ][ classical mechanics, cannot be maintained ; in other words, the law ][  ][ that we
 have just written down does not hold in reality. For the time ][  ][ being, however, we shall assume its correctness. ][  ][ TH
E APPARENT INCOMPATIBILITY OF THE ][  ][ LAW OF PROPAGATION OF LIGHT WITH THE ][  ][ PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ There is har
dly a simpler law in physics than that according to which ][  ][ light is propagated in empty space. Every child at school knows
, or ][  ][ believes he knows, that this propagation takes place in straight lines ][  ][ with a velocity c= 300,000 km./sec. At
 all events we know with great ][  ][ exactness that this velocity is the same for all colours, because if ][  ][ this were not 
the case, the minimum of emission would not be observed ][  ][ simultaneously for different colours during the eclipse of a fixe
d ][  ][ star by its dark neighbour. By means of similar considerations based ][  ][ on observa- tions of double stars, the Dutc
h astronomer De Sitter was ][  ][ also able to show that the velocity of propagation of light cannot ][  ][ depend on the veloci
ty of motion of the body emitting the light. The ][  ][ assumption that this velocity of propagation is dependent on the ][  ][ 
direction "in space" is in itself improbable. ][  ][ In short, let us assume that the simple law of the constancy of the ][  ][ 
velocity of light c (in vacuum) is justifiably believed by the child ][  ][ at school. Who would imagine that this simple law ha
s plunged the ][  ][ conscientiously thoughtful physicist into the greatest intellectual ][  ][ difficulties? Let us consider ho
w these difficulties arise. ][  ][ Of course we must refer the process of the propagation of light (and ][  ][ indeed every othe
r process) to a rigid reference-body (co-ordinate ][  ][ system). As such a system let us again choose our embankment. We shall 
][  ][ imagine the air above it to have been removed. If a ray of light be ][  ][ sent along the embankment, we see from the abo
ve that the tip of the ][  ][ ray will be transmitted with the velocity c relative to the ][  ][ embankment. Now let us suppose 
that our railway carriage is again ][  ][ travelling along the railway lines with the velocity v, and that its ][  ][ direction 
is the same as that of the ray of light, but its velocity of ][  ][ course much less. Let us inquire about the velocity of propa
gation of ][  ][ the ray of light relative to the carriage. It is obvious that we can ][  ][ here apply the consideration of the
 previous section, since the ray of ][  ][ light plays the part of the man walking along relatively to the ][  ][ carriage. The 
velocity w of the man relative to the embankment is here ][  ][ replaced by the velocity of light relative to the embankment. w 
is the ][  ][ required velocity of light with respect to the carriage, and we have ][  ][                                w = c-v
. ][  ][ The velocity of propagation ot a ray of light relative to the carriage ][  ][ thus comes cut smaller than c. ][  ][ But
 this result comes into conflict with the principle of relativity ][  ][ set forth in Section V. For, like every other general l
aw of ][  ][ nature, the law of the transmission of light in vacuo [in vacuum] ][  ][ must, according to the principle of relati
vity, be the same for the ][  ][ railway carriage as reference-body as when the rails are the body of ][  ][ reference. But, fro
m our above consideration, this would appear to be ][  ][ impossible. If every ray of light is propagated relative to the ][  ][
 embankment with the velocity c, then for this reason it would appear ][  ][ that another law of propagation of light must neces
sarily hold with ][  ][ respect to the carriage -- a result contradictory to the principle of ][  ][ relativity. ][  ][ In view 
of this dilemma there appears to be nothing else for it than ][  ][ to abandon either the principle of relativity or the simple 
law of the ][  ][ propagation of light in vacuo. Those of you who have carefully ][  ][ followed the preceding discussion are al
most sure to expect that we ][  ][ should retain the principle of relativity, which appeals so ][  ][ convincingly to the intell
ect because it is so natural and simple. The ][  ][ law of the propagation of light in vacuo would then have to be ][  ][ replac
ed by a more complicated law conformable to the principle of ][  ][ relativity. The development of theoretical physics shows, ho
wever, ][  ][ that we cannot pursue this course. The epoch-making theoretical ][  ][ investigations of H. A. Lorentz on the elec
trodynamical and optical ][  ][ phenomena connected with moving bodies show that experience in this ][  ][ domain leads conclusi
vely to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena, of ][  ][ which the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo is a ]
[  ][ necessary consequence. Prominent theoretical physicists were theref ][  ][ ore more inclined to reject the principle of re
lativity, in spite of ][  ][ the fact that no empirical data had been found which were ][  ][ contradictory to this principle. ]
[  ][ At this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena. As a ][  ][ result of an analysis of the physical conceptions
 of time and space, ][  ][ it became evident that in realily there is not the least ][  ][ incompatibilitiy between the principl
e of relativity and the law of ][  ][ propagation of light, and that by systematically holding fast to both ][  ][ these laws a 
logically rigid theory could be arrived at. This theory ][  ][ has been called the special theory of relativity to distinguish i
t ][  ][ from the extended theory, with which we shall deal later. In the ][  ][ following pages we shall present the fundamenta
l ideas of the special ][  ][ theory of relativity. ][  ][ ON THE IDEA OF TIME IN PHYSICS ][  ][ Lightning has struck the rails 
on our railway embankment at two places ][  ][ A and B far distant from each other. I make the additional assertion ][  ][ that 
these two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously. If I ask you ][  ][ whether there is sense in this statement, you will answ
er my question ][  ][ with a decided "Yes." But if I now approach you with the request to ][  ][ explain to me the sense of the 
statement more precisely, you find ][  ][ after some consideration that the answer to this question is not so ][  ][ easy as it 
appears at first sight. ][  ][ After some time perhaps the following answer would occur to you: "The ][  ][ significance of the 
statement is clear in itself and needs no further ][  ][ explanation; of course it would require some consideration if I were ][
  ][ to be commissioned to determine by observations whether in the actual ][  ][ case the two events took place simultaneously 
or not." I cannot be ][  ][ satisfied with this answer for the following reason. Supposing that as ][  ][ a result of ingenious 
considerations an able meteorologist were to ][  ][ discover that the lightning must always strike the places A and B ][  ][ sim
ultaneously, then we should be faced with the task of testing ][  ][ whether or not this theoretical result is in accordance wit
h the ][  ][ reality. We encounter the same difficulty with all physical statements ][  ][ in which the conception " simultaneou
s " plays a part. The concept ][  ][ does not exist for the physicist until he has the possibility of ][  ][ discovering whether
 or not it is fulfilled in an actual case. We thus ][  ][ require a definition of simultaneity such that this definition ][  ][ 
supplies us with the method by means of which, in the present case, he ][  ][ can decide by experiment whether or not both the l
ightning strokes ][  ][ occurred simultaneously. As long as this requirement is not satisfied, ][  ][ I allow myself to be decei
ved as a physicist (and of course the same ][  ][ applies if I am not a physicist), when I imagine that I am able to ][  ][ atta
ch a meaning to the statement of simultaneity. (I would ask the ][  ][ reader not to proceed farther until he is fully convinced
 on this ][  ][ point.) ][  ][ After thinking the matter over for some time you then offer the ][  ][ following suggestion with 
which to test simultaneity. By measuring ][  ][ along the rails, the connecting line AB should be measured up and an ][  ][ obse
rver placed at the mid-point M of the distance AB. This observer ][  ][ should be supplied with an arrangement (e.g. two mirrors
 inclined at ][  ][ 90^0) which allows him visually to observe both places A and B at the ][  ][ same time. If the observer perc
eives the two flashes of lightning at ][  ][ the same time, then they are simultaneous. ][  ][ I am very pleased with this sugge
stion, but for all that I cannot ][  ][ regard the matter as quite settled, because I feel constrained to ][  ][ raise the follo
wing objection: ][  ][ "Your definition would certainly be right, if only I knew that the ][  ][ light by means of which the obs
erver at M perceives the lightning ][  ][ flashes travels along the length A arrow M with the same velocity as ][  ][ along the 
length B arrow M. But an examination of this supposition ][  ][ would only be possible if we already had at our disposal the mea
ns of ][  ][ measuring time. It would thus appear as though we were moving here in ][  ][ a logical circle." ][  ][ After furthe
r consideration you cast a somewhat disdainful glance at ][  ][ me -- and rightly so -- and you declare: ][  ][ "I maintain my p
revious definition nevertheless, because in reality it ][  ][ assumes absolutely nothing about light. There is only one demand t
o be ][  ][ made of the definition of simultaneity, namely, that in every real ][  ][ case it must supply us with an empirical d
ecision as to whether or not ][  ][ the conception that has to be defined is fulfilled. That my definition ][  ][ satisfies this
 demand is indisputable. That light requires the same ][  ][ time to traverse the path A arrow M as for the path B arrow M is in
 ][  ][ reality neither a supposition nor a hypothesis about the physical ][  ][ nature of light, but a stipulation which I can 
make of my own freewill ][  ][ in order to arrive at a definition of simultaneity." ][  ][ It is clear that this definition can 
be used to give an exact meaning ][  ][ not only to two events, but to as many events as we care to choose, ][  ][ and independe
ntly of the positions of the scenes of the events with ][  ][ respect to the body of reference * (here the railway embankment). 
][  ][ We are thus led also to a definition of " time " in physics. For this ][  ][ purpose we suppose that clocks of identical 
construction are placed at ][  ][ the points A, B and C of the railway line (co-ordinate system) and ][  ][ that they are set in
 such a manner that the positions of their ][  ][ pointers are simultaneously (in the above sense) the same. Under these ][  ][ 
conditions we understand by the " time " of an event the reading ][  ][ (position of the hands) of that one of these clocks whic
h is in the ][  ][ immediate vicinity (in space) of the event. In this manner a ][  ][ time-value is associated with every event
 which is essentially capable ][  ][ of observation. ][  ][ This stipulation contains a further physical hypothesis, the validit
y ][  ][ of which will hardly be doubted without empirical evidence to the ][  ][ contrary. It has been assumed that all these c
locks go at the same ][  ][ rate if they are of identical construction. Stated more exactly: When ][  ][ two clocks arranged at 
rest in different places of a reference-body ][  ][ are set in such a manner that a particular position of the pointers of ][  ]
[ the one clock is simultaneous (in the above sense) with the same ][  ][ position, of the pointers of the other clock, then ide
ntical " ][  ][ settings " are always simultaneous (in the sense of the above ][  ][ definition). ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) We su
ppose further, that, when three events A, B and C occur in ][  ][ different places in such a manner that A is simultaneous with 
B and B ][  ][ is simultaneous with C (simultaneous in the sense of the above ][  ][ definition), then the criterion for the sim
ultaneity of the pair of ][  ][ events A, C is also satisfied. This assumption is a physical ][  ][ hypothesis about the the of 
propagation of light: it must certainly be ][  ][ fulfilled if we are to maintain the law of the constancy of the ][  ][ velocit
y of light in vacuo. ][  ][ THE RELATIVITY OF SIMULATNEITY ][  ][ Up to now our considerations have been referred to a particula
r body ][  ][ of reference, which we have styled a " railway embankment." We suppose ][  ][ a very long train travelling along t
he rails with the constant ][  ][ velocity v and in the direction indicated in Fig 1. People travelling ][  ][ in this train wil
l with a vantage view the train as a rigid ][  ][ reference-body (co-ordinate system); they regard all events in ][  ][         
               Fig. 01: file fig01.gif ][  ][ reference to the train. Then every event which takes place along the ][  ][ line a
lso takes place at a particular point of the train. Also the ][  ][ definition of simultaneity can be given relative to the trai
n in ][  ][ exactly the same way as with respect to the embankment. As a natural ][  ][ consequence, however, the following ques
tion arises : ][  ][ Are two events (e.g. the two strokes of lightning A and B) which are ][  ][ simultaneous with reference to 
the railway embankment also ][  ][ simultaneous relatively to the train? We shall show directly that the ][  ][ answer must be i
n the negative. ][  ][ When we say that the lightning strokes A and B are simultaneous with ][  ][ respect to be embankment, we 
mean: the rays of light emitted at the ][  ][ places A and B, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at the ][  ][ mid-poin
t M of the length A arrow B of the embankment. But the events ][  ][ A and B also correspond to positions A and B on the train. 
Let M1 be ][  ][ the mid-point of the distance A arrow B on the travelling train. Just ][  ][ when the flashes (as judged from t
he embankment) of lightning occur, ][  ][ this point M1 naturally coincides with the point M but it moves ][  ][ towards the rig
ht in the diagram with the velocity v of the train. If ][  ][ an observer sitting in the position M1 in the train did not posses
s ][  ][ this velocity, then he would remain permanently at M, and the light ][  ][ rays emitted by the flashes of lightning A a
nd B would reach him ][  ][ simultaneously, i.e. they would meet just where he is situated. Now in ][  ][ reality (considered wi
th reference to the railway embankment) he is ][  ][ hastening towards the beam of light coming from B, whilst he is riding ][  
][ on ahead of the beam of light coming from A. Hence the observer will ][  ][ see the beam of light emitted from B earlier than
 he will see that ][  ][ emitted from A. Observers who take the railway train as their ][  ][ reference-body must therefore come
 to the conclusion that the ][  ][ lightning flash B took place earlier than the lightning flash A. We ][  ][ thus arrive at the
 important result: ][  ][ Events which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not ][  ][ simultaneous with respec
t to the train, and vice versa (relativity of ][  ][ simultaneity). Every reference-body (co-ordinate system) has its own ][  ][
 particular time ; unless we are told the reference-body to which the ][  ][ statement of time refers, there is no meaning in a 
statement of the ][  ][ time of an event. ][  ][ Now before the advent of the theory of relativity it had always ][  ][ tacitly 
been assumed in physics that the statement of time had an ][  ][ absolute significance, i.e. that it is independent of the state
 of ][  ][ motion of the body of reference. But we have just seen that this ][  ][ assumption is incompatible with the most natu
ral definition of ][  ][ simultaneity; if we discard this assumption, then the conflict between ][  ][ the law of the propagatio
n of light in vacuo and the principle of ][  ][ relativity (developed in Section 7) disappears. ][  ][ We were led to that confl
ict by the considerations of Section 6, ][  ][ which are now no longer tenable. In that section we concluded that the ][  ][ man
 in the carriage, who traverses the distance w per second relative ][  ][ to the carriage, traverses the same distance also with
 respect to the ][  ][ embankment in each second of time. But, according to the foregoing ][  ][ considerations, the time requir
ed by a particular occurrence with ][  ][ respect to the carriage must not be considered equal to the duration ][  ][ of the sam
e occurrence as judged from the embankment (as ][  ][ reference-body). Hence it cannot be contended that the man in walking ][  
][ travels the distance w relative to the railway line in a time which is ][  ][ equal to one second as judged from the embankme
nt. ][  ][ Moreover, the considerations of Section 6 are based on yet a second ][  ][ assumption, which, in the light of a stric
t consideration, appears to ][  ][ be arbitrary, although it was always tacitly made even before the ][  ][ introduction of the 
theory of relativity. ][  ][ ON THE RELATIVITY OF THE CONCEPTION OF DISTANCE ][  ][ Let us consider two particular points on the
 train * travelling ][  ][ along the embankment with the velocity v, and inquire as to their ][  ][ distance apart. We already k
now that it is necessary to have a body of ][  ][ reference for the measurement of a distance, with respect to which ][  ][ body
 the distance can be measured up. It is the simplest plan to use ][  ][ the train itself as reference-body (co-ordinate system).
 An observer ][  ][ in the train measures the interval by marking off his measuring-rod in ][  ][ a straight line (e.g. along th
e floor of the carriage) as many times ][  ][ as is necessary to take him from the one marked point to the other. ][  ][ Then th
e number which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down ][  ][ is the required distance. ][  ][ It is a different matter w
hen the distance has to be judged from the ][  ][ railway line. Here the following method suggests itself. If we call ][  ][ A^1
 and B^1 the two points on the train whose distance apart is ][  ][ required, then both of these points are moving with the velo
city v ][  ][ along the embankment. In the first place we require to determine the ][  ][ points A and B of the embankment which
 are just being passed by the ][  ][ two points A^1 and B^1 at a particular time t -- judged from the ][  ][ embankment. These p
oints A and B of the embankment can be determined ][  ][ by applying the definition of time given in Section 8. The distance ][ 
 ][ between these points A and B is then measured by repeated application ][  ][ of thee measuring-rod along the embankment. ][ 
 ][ A priori it is by no means certain that this last measurement will ][  ][ supply us with the same result as the first. Thus 
the length of the ][  ][ train as measured from the embankment may be different from that ][  ][ obtained by measuring in the tr
ain itself. This circumstance leads us ][  ][ to a second objection which must be raised against the apparently ][  ][ obvious c
onsideration of Section 6. Namely, if the man in the ][  ][ carriage covers the distance w in a unit of time -- measured from th
e ][  ][ train, -- then this distance -- as measured from the embankment -- is ][  ][ not necessarily also equal to w. ][  ][   
Notes ][  ][ *) e.g. the middle of the first and of the hundredth carriage. ][  ][ THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION ][  ][ The results
 of the last three sections show that the apparent ][  ][ incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle 
][  ][ of relativity (Section 7) has been derived by means of a ][  ][ consideration which borrowed two unjustifiable hypotheses
 from ][  ][ classical mechanics; these are as follows: ][  ][ (1) The time-interval (time) between two events is independent of
 the ][  ][ condition of motion of the body of reference. ][  ][ (2) The space-interval (distance) between two points of a rigid
 body ][  ][ is independent of the condition of motion of the body of reference. ][  ][ If we drop these hypotheses, then the di
lemma of Section 7 ][  ][ disappears, because the theorem of the addition of velocities derived ][  ][ in Section 6 becomes inva
lid. The possibility presents itself that ][  ][ the law of the propagation of light in vacuo may be compatible with ][  ][ the 
principle of relativity, and the question arises: How have we to ][  ][ modify the considerations of Section 6 in order to remov
e the ][  ][ apparent disagreement between these two fundamental results of ][  ][ experience? This question leads to a general 
one. In the discussion of ][  ][ Section 6 we have to do with places and times relative both to the ][  ][ train and to the emba
nkment. How are we to find the place and time of ][  ][ an event in relation to the train, when we know the place and time of ][
  ][ the event with respect to the railway embankment ? Is there a ][  ][ thinkable answer to this question of such a nature tha
t the law of ][  ][ transmission of light in vacuo does not contradict the principle of ][  ][ relativity ? In other words : Can
 we conceive of a relation between ][  ][ place and time of the individual events relative to both ][  ][ reference-bodies, such
 that every ray of light possesses the velocity ][  ][ of transmission c relative to the embankment and relative to the train ][
  ][ ? This question leads to a quite definite positive answer, and to a ][  ][ perfectly definite transformation law for the sp
ace-time magnitudes of ][  ][ an event when changing over from one body of reference to another. ][  ][ Before we deal with this
, we shall introduce the following incidental ][  ][ consideration. Up to the present we have only considered events taking ][  
][ place along the embankment, which had mathematically to assume the ][  ][ function of a straight line. In the manner indicate
d in Section 2 ][  ][ we can imagine this reference-body supplemented laterally and in a ][  ][ vertical direction by means of a
 framework of rods, so that an event ][  ][ which takes place anywhere can be localised with reference to this ][  ][ framework.
 Fig. 2 Similarly, we can imagine the train travelling with ][  ][ the velocity v to be continued across the whole of space, so 
that ][  ][ every event, no matter how far off it may be, could also be localised ][  ][ with respect to the second framework. W
ithout committing any ][  ][ fundamental error, we can disregard the fact that in reality these ][  ][ frameworks would continua
lly interfere with each other, owing to the ][  ][ impenetrability of solid bodies. In every such framework we imagine ][  ][ th
ree surfaces perpendicular to each other marked out, and designated ][  ][ as " co-ordinate planes " (" co-ordinate system "). A
 co-ordinate ][  ][ system K then corresponds to the embankment, and a co-ordinate system ][  ][ K' to the train. An event, wher
ever it may have taken place, would be ][  ][ fixed in space with respect to K by the three perpendiculars x, y, z ][  ][ on the
 co-ordinate planes, and with regard to time by a time value t. ][  ][ Relative to K1, the same event would be fixed in respect 
of space and ][  ][ time by corresponding values x1, y1, z1, t1, which of course are not ][  ][ identical with x, y, z, t. It ha
s already been set forth in detail how ][  ][ these magnitudes are to be regarded as results of physical ][  ][ measurements. ][
  ][ Obviously our problem can be exactly formulated in the following ][  ][ manner. What are the values x1, y1, z1, t1, of an e
vent with respect ][  ][ to K1, when the magnitudes x, y, z, t, of the same event with respect ][  ][ to K are given ? The relat
ions must be so chosen that the law of the ][  ][ transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied for one and the same ray ][  ][ of
 light (and of course for every ray) with respect to K and K1. For ][  ][ the relative orientation in space of the co-ordinate s
ystems indicated ][  ][ in the diagram ([7]Fig. 2), this problem is solved by means of the ][  ][ equations : ][  ][            
              eq. 1: file eq01.gif ][  ][                                 y1 = y ][  ][                                 z1 = z ]
[  ][                          eq. 2: file eq02.gif ][  ][ This system of equations is known as the " Lorentz transformation." *
 ][  ][ If in place of the law of transmission of light we had taken as our ][  ][ basis the tacit assumptions of the older mech
anics as to the absolute ][  ][ character of times and lengths, then instead of the above we should ][  ][ have obtained the fol
lowing equations: ][  ][                              x1 = x - vt ][  ][                                 y1 = y ][  ][          
                       z1 = z ][  ][                                 t1 = t ][  ][ This system of equations is often termed the 
" Galilei ][  ][ transformation." The Galilei transformation can be obtained from the ][  ][ Lorentz transformation by substitut
ing an infinitely large value for ][  ][ the velocity of light c in the latter transformation. ][  ][ Aided by the following ill
ustration, we can readily see that, in ][  ][ accordance with the Lorentz transformation, the law of the ][  ][ transmission of 
light in vacuo is satisfied both for the ][  ][ reference-body K and for the reference-body K1. A light-signal is sent ][  ][ al
ong the positive x-axis, and this light-stimulus advances in ][  ][ accordance with the equation ][  ][                         
       x = ct, ][  ][ i.e. with the velocity c. According to the equations of the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation, this simple rel
ation between x and t involves a ][  ][ relation between x1 and t1. In point of fact, if we substitute for x ][  ][ the value ct
 in the first and fourth equations of the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation, we obtain: ][  ][                          eq. 3: file 
eq03.gif ][  ][                          eq. 4: file eq04.gif ][  ][ from which, by division, the expression ][  ][             
                   x1 = ct1 ][  ][ immediately follows. If referred to the system K1, the propagation of ][  ][ light takes plac
e according to this equation. We thus see that the ][  ][ velocity of transmission relative to the reference-body K1 is also ][ 
 ][ equal to c. The same result is obtained for rays of light advancing in ][  ][ any other direction whatsoever. Of cause this 
is not surprising, since ][  ][ the equations of the Lorentz transformation were derived conformably ][  ][ to this point of vie
w. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) A simple derivation of the Lorentz transformation is given in ][  ][ Appendix I. ][  ][ THE BEHAVIOU
R OF MEASURING-RODS AND CLOCKS IN MOTION ][  ][ Place a metre-rod in the x1-axis of K1 in such a manner that one end ][  ][ (the
 beginning) coincides with the point x1=0 whilst the other end ][  ][ (the end of the rod) coincides with the point x1=I. What i
s the length ][  ][ of the metre-rod relatively to the system K? In order to learn this, ][  ][ we need only ask where the begin
ning of the rod and the end of the rod ][  ][ lie with respect to K at a particular time t of the system K. By means ][  ][ of t
he first equation of the Lorentz transformation the values of ][  ][ these two points at the time t = 0 can be shown to be ][  ]
[                        eq. 05a: file eq05a.gif ][  ][                        eq. 05b: file eq05b.gif ][  ][ the distance betwe
en the points being eq. 06 . ][  ][ But the metre-rod is moving with the velocity v relative to K. It ][  ][ therefore follows t
hat the length of a rigid metre-rod moving in the ][  ][ direction of its length with a velocity v is eq. 06 of a metre. ][  ][ 
The rigid rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at rest, and ][  ][ the more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod
. For the ][  ][ velocity v=c we should have eq. 06a , ][  ][ and for stiII greater velocities the square-root becomes imaginary
. ][  ][ From this we conclude that in the theory of relativity the velocity c ][  ][ plays the part of a limiting velocity, whi
ch can neither be reached ][  ][ nor exceeded by any real body. ][  ][ Of course this feature of the velocity c as a limiting ve
locity also ][  ][ clearly follows from the equations of the Lorentz transformation, for ][  ][ these became meaningless if we c
hoose values of v greater than c. ][  ][ If, on the contrary, we had considered a metre-rod at rest in the ][  ][ x-axis with re
spect to K, then we should have found that the length of ][  ][ the rod as judged from K1 would have been eq. 06 ; ][  ][ this i
s quite in accordance with the principle of relativity which ][  ][ forms the basis of our considerations. ][  ][ A Priori it is
 quite clear that we must be able to learn something ][  ][ about the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the ]
[  ][ equations of transformation, for the magnitudes z, y, x, t, are ][  ][ nothing more nor less than the results of measureme
nts obtainable by ][  ][ means of measuring-rods and clocks. If we had based our considerations ][  ][ on the Galileian transfor
mation we should not have obtained a ][  ][ contraction of the rod as a consequence of its motion. ][  ][ Let us now consider a 
seconds-clock which is permanently situated at ][  ][ the origin (x1=0) of K1. t1=0 and t1=I are two successive ticks of ][  ][ 
this clock. The first and fourth equations of the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation give for these two ticks : ][  ][               
                  t = 0 ][  ][ and ][  ][                         eq. 07: file eq07.gif ][  ][ As judged from K, the clock is mo
ving with the velocity v; as judged ][  ][ from this reference-body, the time which elapses between two strokes ][  ][ of the cl
ock is not one second, but ][  ][                         eq. 08: file eq08.gif ][  ][ seconds, i.e. a somewhat larger time. As 
a consequence of its motion ][  ][ the clock goes more slowly than when at rest. Here also the velocity c ][  ][ plays the part 
of an unattainable limiting velocity. ][  ][ THEOREM OF THE ADDITION OF VELOCITIES. ][  ][ THE EXPERIMENT OF FIZEAU ][  ][ Now i
n practice we can move clocks and measuring-rods only with ][  ][ velocities that are small compared with the velocity of light;
 hence ][  ][ we shall hardly be able to compare the results of the previous section ][  ][ directly with the reality. But, on t
he other hand, these results must ][  ][ strike you as being very singular, and for that reason I shall now ][  ][ draw another 
conclusion from the theory, one which can easily be ][  ][ derived from the foregoing considerations, and which has been most ][
  ][ elegantly confirmed by experiment. ][  ][ In Section 6 we derived the theorem of the addition of velocities ][  ][ in one d
irection in the form which also results from the hypotheses of ][  ][ classical mechanics- This theorem can also be deduced read
ily horn the ][  ][ Galilei transformation (Section 11). In place of the man walking ][  ][ inside the carriage, we introduce a 
point moving relatively to the ][  ][ co-ordinate system K1 in accordance with the equation ][  ][                              
  x1 = wt1 ][  ][ By means of the first and fourth equations of the Galilei ][  ][ transformation we can express x1 and t1 in te
rms of x and t, and we ][  ][ then obtain ][  ][                              x = (v + w)t ][  ][ This equation expresses nothin
g else than the law of motion of the ][  ][ point with reference to the system K (of the man with reference to the ][  ][ embank
ment). We denote this velocity by the symbol W, and we then ][  ][ obtain, as in Section 6, ][  ][                            W=
v+w         A) ][  ][ But we can carry out this consideration just as well on the basis of ][  ][ the theory of relativity. In t
he equation ][  ][                          x1 = wt1         B) ][  ][ we must then express x1and t1 in terms of x and t, making
 use of the ][  ][ first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation. Instead of ][  ][ the equation (A) we then obtain t
he equation ][  ][                         eq. 09: file eq09.gif ][  ][ which corresponds to the theorem of addition for velocit
ies in one ][  ][ direction according to the theory of relativity. The question now ][  ][ arises as to which of these two theor
ems is the better in accord with ][  ][ experience. On this point we axe enlightened by a most important ][  ][ experiment which
 the brilliant physicist Fizeau performed more than ][  ][ half a century ago, and which has been repeated since then by some of
 ][  ][ the best experimental physicists, so that there can be no doubt about ][  ][ its result. The experiment is concerned wit
h the following question. ][  ][ Light travels in a motionless liquid with a particular velocity w. How ][  ][ quickly does it t
ravel in the direction of the arrow in the tube T ][  ][ (see the accompanying diagram, Fig. 3) when the liquid above ][  ][ men
tioned is flowing through the tube with a velocity v ? ][  ][ In accordance with the principle of relativity we shall certainly 
have ][  ][ to take for granted that the propagation of light always takes place ][  ][ with the same velocity w with respect to
 the liquid, whether the ][  ][ latter is in motion with reference to other bodies or not. The ][  ][ velocity of light relative
 to the liquid and the velocity of the ][  ][ latter relative to the tube are thus known, and we require the ][  ][ velocity of 
light relative to the tube. ][  ][ It is clear that we have the problem of Section 6 again before us. The ][  ][ tube plays the 
part of the railway embankment or of the co-ordinate ][  ][ system K, the liquid plays the part of the carriage or of the ][  ][
 co-ordinate system K1, and finally, the light plays the part of the ][  ][                       Figure 03: file fig03.gif ][  
][ man walking along the carriage, or of the moving point in the present ][  ][ section. If we denote the velocity of the light 
relative to the tube ][  ][ by W, then this is given by the equation (A) or (B), according as the ][  ][ Galilei transformation 
or the Lorentz transformation corresponds to ][  ][ the facts. Experiment * decides in favour of equation (B) derived ][  ][ fro
m the theory of relativity, and the agreement is, indeed, very ][  ][ exact. According to recent and most excellent measurements
 by Zeeman, ][  ][ the influence of the velocity of flow v on the propagation of light is ][  ][ represented by formula (B) to w
ithin one per cent. ][  ][ Nevertheless we must now draw attention to the fact that a theory of ][  ][ this phenomenon was given
 by H. A. Lorentz long before the statement ][  ][ of the theory of relativity. This theory was of a purely ][  ][ electrodynami
cal nature, and was obtained by the use of particular ][  ][ hypotheses as to the electromagnetic structure of matter. This ][  
][ circumstance, however, does not in the least diminish the ][  ][ conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial test in favour
 of the ][  ][ theory of relativity, for the electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz, on ][  ][ which the original theory was based, 
in no way opposes the theory of ][  ][ relativity. Rather has the latter been developed trom electrodynamics ][  ][ as an astoun
dingly simple combination and generalisation of the ][  ][ hypotheses, formerly independent of each other, on which ][  ][ elect
rodynamics was built. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) Fizeau found eq. 10 , where eq. 11 ][  ][ is the index of refraction of the liqui
d. On the other hand, owing to ][  ][ the smallness of eq. 12 as compared with I, ][  ][ we can replace (B) in the first place b
y eq. 13 , or to the same order ][  ][ of approximation by ][  ][ eq. 14 , which agrees with Fizeau's result. ][  ][ THE HEURIST
IC VALUE OF THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ Our train of thought in the foregoing pages can be epitomised in the ][  ][ followin
g manner. Experience has led to the conviction that, on the ][  ][ one hand, the principle of relativity holds true and that on 
the other ][  ][ hand the velocity of transmission of light in vacuo has to be ][  ][ considered equal to a constant c. By uniti
ng these two postulates we ][  ][ obtained the law of transformation for the rectangular co-ordinates x, ][  ][ y, z and the tim
e t of the events which constitute the processes of ][  ][ nature. In this connection we did not obtain the Galilei ][  ][ trans
formation, but, differing from classical mechanics, the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation. ][  ][ The law of transmission of light, 
the acceptance of which is justified ][  ][ by our actual knowledge, played an important part in this process of ][  ][ thought.
 Once in possession of the Lorentz transformation, however, we ][  ][ can combine this with the principle of relativity, and sum
 up the ][  ][ theory thus: ][  ][ Every general law of nature must be so constituted that it is ][  ][ transformed into a law o
f exactly the same form when, instead of the ][  ][ space-time variables x, y, z, t of the original coordinate system K, ][  ][ 
we introduce new space-time variables x1, y1, z1, t1 of a co-ordinate ][  ][ system K1. In this connection the relation between 
the ordinary and ][  ][ the accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz transformation. Or in ][  ][ brief : General laws of nat
ure are co-variant with respect to Lorentz ][  ][ transformations. ][  ][ This is a definite mathematical condition that the the
ory of ][  ][ relativity demands of a natural law, and in virtue of this, the theory ][  ][ becomes a valuable heuristic aid in 
the search for general laws of ][  ][ nature. If a general law of nature were to be found which did not ][  ][ satisfy this cond
ition, then at least one of the two fundamental ][  ][ assumptions of the theory would have been disproved. Let us now ][  ][ ex
amine what general results the latter theory has hitherto evinced. ][  ][ GENERAL RESULTS OF THE THEORY ][  ][ It is clear from 
our previous considerations that the (special) theory ][  ][ of relativity has grown out of electrodynamics and optics. In these
 ][  ][ fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions of theory, but ][  ][ it has considerably simplified the theoretic
al structure, i.e. the ][  ][ derivation of laws, and -- what is incomparably more important -- it ][  ][ has considerably reduc
ed the number of independent hypothese forming ][  ][ the basis of theory. The special theory of relativity has rendered the ][ 
 ][ Maxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the latter would have been ][  ][ generally accepted by physicists even if experim
ent had decided less ][  ][ unequivocally in its favour. ][  ][ Classical mechanics required to be modified before it could come
 into ][  ][ line with the demands of the special theory of relativity. For the ][  ][ main part, however, this modification aff
ects only the laws for rapid ][  ][ motions, in which the velocities of matter v are not very small as ][  ][ compared with the 
velocity of light. We have experience of such rapid ][  ][ motions only in the case of electrons and ions; for other motions the
 ][  ][ variations from the laws of classical mechanics are too small to make ][  ][ themselves evident in practice. We shall no
t consider the motion of ][  ][ stars until we come to speak of the general theory of relativity. In ][  ][ accordance with the 
theory of relativity the kinetic energy of a ][  ][ material point of mass m is no longer given by the well-known ][  ][ express
ion ][  ][                         eq. 15: file eq15.gif ][  ][ but by the expression ][  ][                         eq. 16: fil
e eq16.gif ][  ][ This expression approaches infinity as the velocity v approaches the ][  ][ velocity of light c. The velocity 
must therefore always remain less ][  ][ than c, however great may be the energies used to produce the ][  ][ acceleration. If w
e develop the expression for the kinetic energy in ][  ][ the form of a series, we obtain ][  ][                         eq. 17:
 file eq17.gif ][  ][ When eq. 18 is small compared with unity, the third of these terms is ][  ][ always small in comparison wi
th the second, ][  ][ which last is alone considered in classical mechanics. The first term ][  ][ mc^2 does not contain the vel
ocity, and requires no consideration if ][  ][ we are only dealing with the question as to how the energy of a ][  ][ point-mass
; depends on the velocity. We shall speak of its essential ][  ][ significance later. ][  ][ The most important result of a gene
ral character to which the special ][  ][ theory of relativity has led is concerned with the conception of mass. ][  ][ Before t
he advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation ][  ][ laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the canse
rvation of ][  ][ energy and the law of the conservation of mass these two fundamental ][  ][ laws appeared to be quite independ
ent of each other. By means of the ][  ][ theory of relativity they have been united into one law. We shall now ][  ][ briefly c
onsider how this unification came about, and what meaning is ][  ][ to be attached to it. ][  ][ The principle of relativity req
uires that the law of the concervation ][  ][ of energy should hold not only with reference to a co-ordinate system ][  ][ K, bu
t also with respect to every co-ordinate system K1 which is in a ][  ][ state of uniform motion of translation relative to K, or
, briefly, ][  ][ relative to every " Galileian " system of co-ordinates. In contrast to ][  ][ classical mechanics; the Lorentz
 transformation is the deciding factor ][  ][ in the transition from one such system to another. ][  ][ By means of comparativel
y simple considerations we are led to draw the ][  ][ following conclusion from these premises, in conjunction with the ][  ][ f
undamental equations of the electrodynamics of Maxwell: A body moving ][  ][ with the velocity v, which absorbs * an amount of e
nergy E[0] in ][  ][ the form of radiation without suffering an alteration in velocity in ][  ][ the process, has, as a conseque
nce, its energy increased by an amount ][  ][                         eq. 19: file eq19.gif ][  ][ In consideration of the expre
ssion given above for the kinetic energy ][  ][ of the body, the required energy of the body comes out to be ][  ][             
            eq. 20: file eq20.gif ][  ][ Thus the body has the same energy as a body of mass ][  ][                          eq.
21: file eq21.gif ][  ][ moving with the velocity v. Hence we can say: If a body takes up an ][  ][ amount of energy E[0], then 
its inertial mass increases by an amount ][  ][                         eq. 22: file eq22.gif ][  ][ the inertial mass of a body
 is not a constant but varies according to ][  ][ the change in the energy of the body. The inertial mass of a system of ][  ][ 
bodies can even be regarded as a measure of its energy. The law of the ][  ][ conservation of the mass of a system becomes ident
ical with the law of ][  ][ the conservation of energy, and is only valid provided that the system ][  ][ neither takes up nor s
ends out energy. Writing the expression for the ][  ][ energy in the form ][  ][                         eq. 23: file eq23.gif ]
[  ][ we see that the term mc^2, which has hitherto attracted our attention, ][  ][ is nothing else than the energy possessed by
 the body ** before it ][  ][ absorbed the energy E[0]. ][  ][ A direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not possi
ble ][  ][ at the present time (1920; see *** Note, p. 48), owing to the fact that ][  ][ the changes in energy E[0] to which we
 can Subject a system are not ][  ][ large enough to make themselves perceptible as a change in the ][  ][ inertial mass of the 
system. ][  ][                                 eq. 22: file eq22.gif ][  ][ is too small in comparison with the mass m, which wa
s present before ][  ][ the alteration of the energy. It is owing to this circumstance that ][  ][ classical mechanics was able 
to establish successfully the ][  ][ conservation of mass as a law of independent validity. ][  ][ Let me add a final remark of 
a fundamental nature. The success of the ][  ][ Faraday-Maxwell interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance ][  ][ re
sulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such ][  ][ things as instantaneous actions at a distance (not involvi
ng an ][  ][ intermediary medium) of the type of Newton's law of gravitation. ][  ][ According to the theory of relativity, acti
on at a distance with the ][  ][ velocity of light always takes the place of instantaneous action at a ][  ][ distance or of act
ion at a distance with an infinite velocity of ][  ][ transmission. This is connected with the fact that the velocity c ][  ][ p
lays a fundamental role in this theory. In Part II we shall see in ][  ][ what way this result becomes modified in the general t
heory of ][  ][ relativity. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) E[0] is the energy taken up, as judged from a co-ordinate system ][  ][ mov
ing with the body. ][  ][ **) As judged from a co-ordinate system moving with the body. ][  ][ ***[Note] The equation E = mc^2 h
as been thoroughly proved time and ][  ][ again since this time. ][  ][ EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ T
o what extent is the special theory of relativity supported by ][  ][ experience?  This question is not easily answered for the 
reason ][  ][ already mentioned in connection with the fundamental experiment of ][  ][ Fizeau. The special theory of relativity
 has crystallised out from the ][  ][ Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electromagnetic phenomena. Thus all facts of ][  ][ experience w
hich support the electromagnetic theory also support the ][  ][ theory of relativity. As being of particular importance, I menti
on ][  ][ here the fact that the theory of relativity enables us to predict the ][  ][ effects produced on the light reaching us
 from the fixed stars. These ][  ][ results are obtained in an exceedingly simple manner, and the effects ][  ][ indicated, whic
h are due to the relative motion of the earth with ][  ][ reference to those fixed stars are found to be in accord with ][  ][ e
xperience. We refer to the yearly movement of the apparent position ][  ][ of the fixed stars resulting from the motion of the e
arth round the ][  ][ sun (aberration), and to the influence of the radial components of the ][  ][ relative motions of the fixe
d stars with respect to the earth on the ][  ][ colour of the light reaching us from them. The latter effect manifests ][  ][ it
self in a slight displacement of the spectral lines of the light ][  ][ transmitted to us from a fixed star, as compared with th
e position of ][  ][ the same spectral lines when they are produced by a terrestrial source ][  ][ of light (Doppler principle).
 The experimental arguments in favour of ][  ][ the Maxwell-Lorentz theory, which are at the same time arguments in ][  ][ favou
r of the theory of relativity, are too numerous to be set forth ][  ][ here. In reality they limit the theoretical possibilities
 to such an ][  ][ extent, that no other theory than that of Maxwell and Lorentz has been ][  ][ able to hold its own when teste
d by experience. ][  ][ But there are two classes of experimental facts hitherto obtained ][  ][ which can be represented in the
 Maxwell-Lorentz theory only by the ][  ][ introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis, which in itself -- i.e. ][  ][ without makin
g use of the theory of relativity -- appears extraneous. ][  ][ It is known that cathode rays and the so-called b-rays emitted b
y ][  ][ radioactive substances consist of negatively electrified particles ][  ][ (electrons) of very small inertia and large v
elocity. By examining the ][  ][ deflection of these rays under the influence of electric and magnetic ][  ][ fields, we can stu
dy the law of motion of these particles very ][  ][ exactly. ][  ][ In the theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are face
d with the ][  ][ difficulty that electrodynamic theory of itself is unable to give an ][  ][ account of their nature. For since
 electrical masses of one sign repel ][  ][ each other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron ][  ][ would ne
cessarily be scattered under the influence of their mutual ][  ][ repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating 
between ][  ][ them, the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us.*   If ][  ][ we now assume that the relative dista
nces between the electrical ][  ][ masses constituting the electron remain unchanged during the motion of ][  ][ the electron (r
igid connection in the sense of classical mechanics), ][  ][ we arrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not agree w
ith ][  ][ experience. Guided by purely formal points of view, H. A. Lorentz was ][  ][ the first to introduce the hypothesis th
at the form of the electron ][  ][ experiences a contraction in the direction of motion in consequence of ][  ][ that motion. th
e contracted length being proportional to the ][  ][ expression ][  ][                         eq. 05: file eq05.gif ][  ][ This
, hypothesis, which is not justifiable by any electrodynamical ][  ][ facts, supplies us then with that particular law of motion
 which has ][  ][ been confirmed with great precision in recent years. ][  ][ The theory of relativity leads to the same law of 
motion, without ][  ][ requiring any special hypothesis whatsoever as to the structure and ][  ][ the behaviour of the electron.
 We arrived at a similar conclusion in ][  ][ Section 13 in connection with the experiment of Fizeau, the result ][  ][ of which
 is foretold by the theory of relativity without the necessity ][  ][ of drawing on hypotheses as to the physical nature of the 
liquid. ][  ][ The second class of facts to which we have alluded has reference to ][  ][ the question whether or not the motion
 of the earth in space can be ][  ][ made perceptible in terrestrial experiments. We have already remarked ][  ][ in Section 5 t
hat all attempts of this nature led to a negative ][  ][ result. Before the theory of relativity was put forward, it was ][  ][ 
difficult to become reconciled to this negative result, for reasons ][  ][ now to be discussed. The inherited prejudices about t
ime and space did ][  ][ not allow any doubt to arise as to the prime importance of the ][  ][ Galileian transformation for chan
ging over from one body of reference ][  ][ to another. Now assuming that the Maxwell-Lorentz equations hold for a ][  ][ refere
nce-body K, we then find that they do not hold for a ][  ][ reference-body K1 moving uniformly with respect to K, if we assume ]
[  ][ that the relations of the Galileian transformstion exist between the ][  ][ co-ordinates of K and K1. It thus appears that
, of all Galileian ][  ][ co-ordinate systems, one (K) corresponding to a particular state of ][  ][ motion is physically unique
. This result was interpreted physically by ][  ][ regarding K as at rest with respect to a hypothetical æther of space. ][  ][
 On the other hand, all coordinate systems K1 moving relatively to K ][  ][ were to be regarded as in motion with respect to the
 æther. To this ][  ][ motion of K1 against the æther ("æther-drift " relative to K1) were ][  ][ attributed the more complic
ated laws which were supposed to hold ][  ][ relative to K1. Strictly speaking, such an æther-drift ought also to ][  ][ be ass
umed relative to the earth, and for a long time the efforts of ][  ][ physicists were devoted to attempts to detect the existenc
e of an ][  ][ æther-drift at the earth's surface. ][  ][ In one of the most notable of these attempts Michelson devised a ][  
][ method which appears as though it must be decisive. Imagine two ][  ][ mirrors so arranged on a rigid body that the reflectin
g surfaces face ][  ][ each other. A ray of light requires a perfectly definite time T to ][  ][ pass from one mirror to the oth
er and back again, if the whole system ][  ][ be at rest with respect to the æther. It is found by calculation, ][  ][ however,
 that a slightly different time T1 is required for this ][  ][ process, if the body, together with the mirrors, be moving relati
vely ][  ][ to the æther. And yet another point: it is shown by calculation that ][  ][ for a given velocity v with reference t
o the æther, this time T1 is ][  ][ different when the body is moving perpendicularly to the planes of the ][  ][ mirrors from 
that resulting when the motion is parallel to these ][  ][ planes. Although the estimated difference between these two times is 
][  ][ exceedingly small, Michelson and Morley performed an experiment ][  ][ involving interference in which this difference sh
ould have been ][  ][ clearly detectable. But the experiment gave a negative result -- a ][  ][ fact very perplexing to physicis
ts. Lorentz and FitzGerald rescued the ][  ][ theory from this difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body ][  ][ relativ
e to the æther produces a contraction of the body in the ][  ][ direction of motion, the amount of contraction being just suffi
cient ][  ][ to compensate for the differeace in time mentioned above. Comparison ][  ][ with the discussion in Section 11 shows
 that also from the ][  ][ standpoint of the theory of relativity this solution of the difficulty ][  ][ was the right one. But 
on the basis of the theory of relativity the ][  ][ method of interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory. According ][  ][
 to this theory there is no such thing as a " specially favoured " ][  ][ (unique) co-ordinate system to occasion the introducti
on of the ][  ][ æther-idea, and hence there can be no æther-drift, nor any experiment ][  ][ with which to demonstrate it. He
re the contraction of moving bodies ][  ][ follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory, without the ][  ][ introdu
ction of particular hypotheses ; and as the prime factor ][  ][ involved in this contraction we find, not the motion in itself, 
to ][  ][ which we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with respect to the ][  ][ body of reference chosen in the particul
ar case in point. Thus for a ][  ][ co-ordinate system moving with the earth the mirror system of ][  ][ Michelson and Morley is
 not shortened, but it is shortened for a ][  ][ co-ordinate system which is at rest relatively to the sun. ][  ][   Notes ][  ]
[ *) The general theory of relativity renders it likely that the ][  ][ electrical masses of an electron are held together by gr
avitational ][  ][ forces. ][  ][ MINKOWSKI'S FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACE ][  ][ The non-mathematician is seized by a mysterious shud
dering when he ][  ][ hears of "four-dimensional" things, by a feeling not unlike that ][  ][ awakened by thoughts of the occult
. And yet there is no more ][  ][ common-place statement than that the world in which we live is a ][  ][ four-dimensional space
-time continuum. ][  ][ Space is a three-dimensional continuum. By this we mean that it is ][  ][ possible to describe the posit
ion of a point (at rest) by means of ][  ][ three numbers (co-ordinales) x, y, z, and that there is an indefinite ][  ][ number 
of points in the neighbourhood of this one, the position of ][  ][ which can be described by co-ordinates such as x[1], y[1], z[
1], which ][  ][ may be as near as we choose to the respective values of the ][  ][ co-ordinates x, y, z, of the first point. In
 virtue of the latter ][  ][ property we speak of a " continuum," and owing to the fact that there ][  ][ are three co-ordinates
 we speak of it as being " three-dimensional." ][  ][ Similarly, the world of physical phenomena which was briefly called " ][  
][ world " by Minkowski is naturally four dimensional in the space-time ][  ][ sense. For it is composed of individual events, e
ach of which is ][  ][ described by four numbers, namely, three space co-ordinates x, y, z, ][  ][ and a time co-ordinate, the t
ime value t. The" world" is in this sense ][  ][ also a continuum; for to every event there are as many "neighbouring" ][  ][ ev
ents (realised or at least thinkable) as we care to choose, the ][  ][ co-ordinates x[1], y[1], z[1], t[1] of which differ by an
 indefinitely ][  ][ small amount from those of the event x, y, z, t originally considered. ][  ][ That we have not been accusto
med to regard the world in this sense as ][  ][ a four-dimensional continuum is due to the fact that in physics, ][  ][ before t
he advent of the theory of relativity, time played a different ][  ][ and more independent role, as compared with the space coor
dinates. It ][  ][ is for this reason that we have been in the habit of treating time as ][  ][ an independent continuum. As a m
atter of fact, according to classical ][  ][ mechanics, time is absolute, i.e. it is independent of the position ][  ][ and the 
condition of motion of the system of co-ordinates. We see this ][  ][ expressed in the last equation of the Galileian transforma
tion (t1 = ][  ][ t) ][  ][ The four-dimensional mode of consideration of the "world" is natural ][  ][ on the theory of relativ
ity, since according to this theory time is ][  ][ robbed of its independence. This is shown by the fourth equation of ][  ][ th
e Lorentz transformation: ][  ][                         eq. 24: file eq24.gif ][  ][ Moreover, according to this equation the t
ime difference Dt1 of two ][  ][ events with respect to K1 does not in general vanish, even when the ][  ][ time difference Dt1 
of the same events with reference to K vanishes. ][  ][ Pure " space-distance " of two events with respect to K results in " ][ 
 ][ time-distance " of the same events with respect to K. But the ][  ][ discovery of Minkowski, which was of importance for the
 formal ][  ][ development of the theory of relativity, does not lie here. It is to ][  ][ be found rather in the fact of his re
cognition that the ][  ][ four-dimensional space-time continuum of the theory of relativity, in ][  ][ its most essential formal
 properties, shows a pronounced relationship ][  ][ to the three-dimensional continuum of Euclidean geometrical ][  ][ space.*  
In order to give due prominence to this relationship, ][  ][ however, we must replace the usual time co-ordinate t by an imagina
ry ][  ][ magnitude eq. 25 proportional to it. Under these conditions, the ][  ][ natural laws satisfying the demands of the (sp
ecial) theory of ][  ][ relativity assume mathematical forms, in which the time co-ordinate ][  ][ plays exactly the same role a
s the three space co-ordinates. Formally, ][  ][ these four co-ordinates correspond exactly to the three space ][  ][ co-ordinat
es in Euclidean geometry. It must be clear even to the ][  ][ non-mathematician that, as a consequence of this purely formal ][ 
 ][ addition to our knowledge, the theory perforce gained clearness in no ][  ][ mean measure. ][  ][ These inadequate remarks c
an give the reader only a vague notion of ][  ][ the important idea contributed by Minkowski. Without it the general ][  ][ theo
ry of relativity, of which the fundamental ideas are developed in ][  ][ the following pages, would perhaps have got no farther 
than its long ][  ][ clothes. Minkowski's work is doubtless difficult of access to anyone ][  ][ inexperienced in mathematics, b
ut since it is not necessary to have a ][  ][ very exact grasp of this work in order to understand the fundamental ][  ][ ideas 
of either the special or the general theory of relativity, I ][  ][ shall leave it here at present, and revert to it only toward
s the end ][  ][ of Part 2. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) Cf. the somewhat more detailed discussion in Appendix II. ][  ][ PART II ][
  ][ THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ SPECIAL AND GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ The basal principle, which was t
he pivot of all our previous ][  ][ considerations, was the special principle of relativity, i.e. the ][  ][ principle of the ph
ysical relativity of all uniform motion. Let as ][  ][ once more analyse its meaning carefully. ][  ][ It was at all times clear
 that, from the point of view of the idea it ][  ][ conveys to us, every motion must be considered only as a relative ][  ][ mot
ion. Returning to the illustration we have frequently used of the ][  ][ embankment and the railway carriage, we can express the
 fact of the ][  ][ motion here taking place in the following two forms, both of which are ][  ][ equally justifiable : ][  ][ (
a) The carriage is in motion relative to the embankment, ][  ][ (b) The embankment is in motion relative to the carriage. ][  ][
 In (a) the embankment, in (b) the carriage, serves as the body of ][  ][ reference in our statement of the motion taking place.
 If it is simply ][  ][ a question of detecting or of describing the motion involved, it is in ][  ][ principle immaterial to wh
at reference-body we refer the motion. As ][  ][ already mentioned, this is self-evident, but it must not be confused ][  ][ wit
h the much more comprehensive statement called "the principle of ][  ][ relativity," which we have taken as the basis of our inv
estigations. ][  ][ The principle we have made use of not only maintains that we may ][  ][ equally well choose the carriage or 
the embankment as our ][  ][ reference-body for the description of any event (for this, too, is ][  ][ self-evident). Our princi
ple rather asserts what follows : If we ][  ][ formulate the general laws of nature as they are obtained from ][  ][ experience,
 by making use of ][  ][ (a) the embankment as reference-body, ][  ][ (b) the railway carriage as reference-body, ][  ][ then th
ese general laws of nature (e.g. the laws of mechanics or the ][  ][ law of the propagation of light in vacuo) have exactly the 
same form ][  ][ in both cases. This can also be expressed as follows : For the ][  ][ physical description of natural processes
, neither of the reference ][  ][ bodies K, K1 is unique (lit. " specially marked out ") as compared ][  ][ with the other. Unli
ke the first, this latter statement need not of ][  ][ necessity hold a priori; it is not contained in the conceptions of " ][  
][ motion" and " reference-body " and derivable from them; only ][  ][ experience can decide as to its correctness or incorrectn
ess. ][  ][ Up to the present, however, we have by no means maintained the ][  ][ equivalence of all bodies of reference K in co
nnection with the ][  ][ formulation of natural laws. Our course was more on the following ][  ][ Iines. In the first place, we 
started out from the assumption that ][  ][ there exists a reference-body K, whose condition of motion is such ][  ][ that the G
alileian law holds with respect to it : A particle left to ][  ][ itself and sufficiently far removed from all other particles m
oves ][  ][ uniformly in a straight line. With reference to K (Galileian ][  ][ reference-body) the laws of nature were to be as
 simple as possible. ][  ][ But in addition to K, all bodies of reference K1 should be given ][  ][ preference in this sense, an
d they should be exactly equivalent to K ][  ][ for the formulation of natural laws, provided that they are in a state ][  ][ of
 uniform rectilinear and non-rotary motion with respect to K ; all ][  ][ these bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galile
ian ][  ][ reference-bodies. The validity of the principle of relativity was ][  ][ assumed only for these reference-bodies, but
 not for others (e.g. ][  ][ those possessing motion of a different kind). In this sense we speak ][  ][ of the special principl
e of relativity, or special theory of ][  ][ relativity. ][  ][ In contrast to this we wish to understand by the "general princi
ple of ][  ][ relativity" the following statement : All bodies of reference K, K1, ][  ][ etc., are equivalent for the descripti
on of natural phenomena ][  ][ (formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their ][  ][ state of motion. But be
fore proceeding farther, it ought to be pointed ][  ][ out that this formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract ][  ]
[ one, for reasons which will become evident at a later stage. ][  ][ Since the introduction of the special principle of relativ
ity has been ][  ][ justified, every intellect which strives after generalisation must ][  ][ feel the temptation to venture the
 step towards the general principle ][  ][ of relativity. But a simple and apparently quite reliable ][  ][ consideration seems 
to suggest that, for the present at any rate, ][  ][ there is little hope of success in such an attempt; Let us imagine ][  ][ o
urselves transferred to our old friend the railway carriage, which is ][  ][ travelling at a uniform rate. As long as it is movi
ng unifromly, the ][  ][ occupant of the carriage is not sensible of its motion, and it is for ][  ][ this reason that he can wi
thout reluctance interpret the facts of the ][  ][ case as indicating that the carriage is at rest, but the embankment in ][  ][
 motion. Moreover, according to the special principle of relativity, ][  ][ this interpretation is quite justified also from a p
hysical point of ][  ][ view. ][  ][ If the motion of the carriage is now changed into a non-uniform ][  ][ motion, as for insta
nce by a powerful application of the brakes, then ][  ][ the occupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful ][ 
 ][ jerk forwards. The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical ][  ][ behaviour of bodies relative to the person in the 
railway carriage. ][  ][ The mechanical behaviour is different from that of the case previously ][  ][ considered, and for this 
reason it would appear to be impossible that ][  ][ the same mechanical laws hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving ][  ][ 
carriage, as hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in ][  ][ uniform motion. At all events it is clear that the Ga
lileian law does ][  ][ not hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because of ][  ][ this, we feel compelled at
 the present juncture to grant a kind of ][  ][ absolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to the ][  ][ gen
eral principle of relatvity. But in what follows we shall soon see ][  ][ that this conclusion cannot be maintained. ][  ][ THE 
GRAVITATIONAL FIELD ][  ][ "If we pick up a stone and then let it go, why does it fall to the ][  ][ ground ?" The usual answer 
to this question is: "Because it is ][  ][ attracted by the earth." Modern physics formulates the answer rather ][  ][ different
ly for the following reason. As a result of the more careful ][  ][ study of electromagnetic phenomena, we have come to regard a
ction at a ][  ][ distance as a process impossible without the intervention of some ][  ][ intermediary medium. If, for instance
, a magnet attracts a piece of ][  ][ iron, we cannot be content to regard this as meaning that the magnet ][  ][ acts directly 
on the iron through the intermediate empty space, but we ][  ][ are constrained to imagine -- after the manner of Faraday -- tha
t the ][  ][ magnet always calls into being something physically real in the space ][  ][ around it, that something being what w
e call a "magnetic field." In ][  ][ its turn this magnetic field operates on the piece of iron, so that ][  ][ the latter striv
es to move towards the magnet. We shall not discuss ][  ][ here the justification for this incidental conception, which is indee
d ][  ][ a somewhat arbitrary one. We shall only mention that with its aid ][  ][ electromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically
 represented much more ][  ][ satisfactorily than without it, and this applies particularly to the ][  ][ transmission of electr
omagnetic waves. The effects of gravitation also ][  ][ are regarded in an analogous manner. ][  ][ The action of the earth on t
he stone takes place indirectly. The earth ][  ][ produces in its surrounding a gravitational field, which acts on the ][  ][ st
one and produces its motion of fall. As we know from experience, the ][  ][ intensity of the action on a body dimishes according
 to a quite ][  ][ definite law, as we proceed farther and farther away from the earth. ][  ][ From our point of view this means
 : The law governing the properties ][  ][ of the gravitational field in space must be a perfectly definite one, ][  ][ in order
 correctly to represent the diminution of gravitational action ][  ][ with the distance from operative bodies. It is something l
ike this: ][  ][ The body (e.g. the earth) produces a field in its immediate ][  ][ neighbourhood directly; the intensity and di
rection of the field at ][  ][ points farther removed from the body are thence determined by the law ][  ][ which governs the pr
operties in space of the gravitational fields ][  ][ themselves. ][  ][ In contrast to electric and magnetic fields, the gravita
tional field ][  ][ exhibits a most remarkable property, which is of fundamental ][  ][ importance for what follows. Bodies whic
h are moving under the sole ][  ][ influence of a gravitational field receive an acceleration, which does ][  ][ not in the leas
t depend either on the material or on the physical ][  ][ state of the body. For instance, a piece of lead and a piece of wood ]
[  ][ fall in exactly the same manner in a gravitational field (in vacuo), ][  ][ when they start off from rest or with the same
 initial velocity. This ][  ][ law, which holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form ][  ][ in the light of the
 following consideration. ][  ][ According to Newton's law of motion, we have ][  ][ (Force) = (inertial mass) x (acceleration),
 ][  ][ where the "inertial mass" is a characteristic constant of the ][  ][ accelerated body. If now gravitation is the cause o
f the acceleration, ][  ][ we then have ][  ][ (Force) = (gravitational mass) x (intensity of the gravitational ][  ][ field), ]
[  ][ where the "gravitational mass" is likewise a characteristic constant ][  ][ for the body. From these two relations follows
: ][  ][                                 eq. 26: file eq26.gif ][  ][ If now, as we find from experience, the acceleration is to
 be ][  ][ independent of the nature and the condition of the body and always the ][  ][ same for a given gravitational field, t
hen the ratio of the ][  ][ gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the same for all ][  ][ bodies. By a suitable ch
oice of units we can thus make this ratio ][  ][ equal to unity. We then have the following law: The gravitational mass ][  ][ o
f a body is equal to its inertial law. ][  ][ It is true that this important law had hitherto been recorded in ][  ][ mechanics,
 but it had not been interpreted. A satisfactory ][  ][ interpretation can be obtained only if we recognise the following fact ]
[  ][ : The same quality of a body manifests itself according to ][  ][ circumstances as " inertia " or as " weight " (lit. " he
aviness '). In ][  ][ the following section we shall show to what extent this is actually ][  ][ the case, and how this question
 is connected with the general ][  ][ postulate of relativity. ][  ][ THE EQUALITY OF INERTIAL AND GRAVITATIONAL MASS ][  ][ AS 
AN ARGUMENT FOR THE GENERAL POSTULE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ We imagine a large portion of empty space, so far removed from stars ][
  ][ and other appreciable masses, that we have before us approximately the ][  ][ conditions required by the fundamental law of
 Galilei. It is then ][  ][ possible to choose a Galileian reference-body for this part of space ][  ][ (world), relative to whi
ch points at rest remain at rest and points in ][  ][ motion continue permanently in uniform rectilinear motion. As ][  ][ refer
ence-body let us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with ][  ][ an observer inside who is equipped with apparatus. Gravi
tation ][  ][ naturally does not exist for this observer. He must fasten himself ][  ][ with strings to the floor, otherwise the
 slightest impact against the ][  ][ floor will cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room. ][  ][ To the middle o
f the lid of the chest is fixed externally a hook with ][  ][ rope attached, and now a " being " (what kind of a being is immate
rial ][  ][ to us) begins pulling at this with a constant force. The chest ][  ][ together with the observer then begin to move 
"upwards" with a ][  ][ uniformly accelerated motion. In course of time their velocity will ][  ][ reach unheard-of values -- pr
ovided that we are viewing all this from ][  ][ another reference-body which is not being pulled with a rope. ][  ][ But how doe
s the man in the chest regard the Process ? The ][  ][ acceleration of the chest will be transmitted to him by the reaction ][  
][ of the floor of the chest. He must therefore take up this pressure by ][  ][ means of his legs if he does not wish to be laid
 out full length on ][  ][ the floor. He is then standing in the chest in exactly the same way as ][  ][ anyone stands in a room
 of a home on our earth. If he releases a body ][  ][ which he previously had in his land, the accelertion of the chest will ][ 
 ][ no longer be transmitted to this body, and for this reason the body ][  ][ will approach the floor of the chest with an acce
lerated relative ][  ][ motion. The observer will further convince himself that the ][  ][ acceleration of the body towards the 
floor of the chest is always of ][  ][ the same magnitude, whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the ][  ][ experiment.
 ][  ][ Relying on his knowledge of the gravitational field (as it was ][  ][ discussed in the preceding section), the man in th
e chest will thus ][  ][ come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational ][  ][ field which is constant with
 regard to time. Of course he will be ][  ][ puzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this ][  ][ gravitational
 field. just then, however, he discovers the hook in the ][  ][ middle of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to
 it, ][  ][ and he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chest is ][  ][ suspended at rest in the gravitational field. ]
[  ][ Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion ? ][  ][ I do not believe we ought to if we wish to re
main consistent ; we must ][  ][ rather admit that his mode of grasping the situation violates neither ][  ][ reason nor known m
echanical laws. Even though it is being accelerated ][  ][ with respect to the "Galileian space" first considered, we can ][  ][
 nevertheless regard the chest as being at rest. We have thus good ][  ][ grounds for extending the principle of relativity to i
nclude bodies of ][  ][ reference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a ][  ][ result we have gained a powe
rful argument for a generalised postulate ][  ][ of relativity. ][  ][ We must note carefully that the possibility of this mode 
of ][  ][ interpretation rests on the fundamental property of the gravitational ][  ][ field of giving all bodies the same accel
eration, or, what comes to ][  ][ the same thing, on the law of the equality of inertial and ][  ][ gravitational mass. If this 
natural law did not exist, the man in the ][  ][ accelerated chest would not be able to interpret the behaviour of the ][  ][ bo
dies around him on the supposition of a gravitational field, and he ][  ][ would not be justified on the grounds of experience i
n supposing his ][  ][ reference-body to be " at rest." ][  ][ Suppose that the man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side 
of ][  ][ the lid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope. The ][  ][ result of this will be to strech the rope
 so that it will hang " ][  ][ vertically " downwards. If we ask for an opinion of the cause of ][  ][ tension in the rope, the 
man in the chest will say: "The suspended ][  ][ body experiences a downward force in the gravitational field, and this ][  ][ i
s neutralised by the tension of the rope ; what determines the ][  ][ magnitude of the tension of the rope is the gravitational 
mass of the ][  ][ suspended body." On the other hand, an observer who is poised freely ][  ][ in space will interpret the condi
tion of things thus : " The rope must ][  ][ perforce take part in the accelerated motion of the chest, and it ][  ][ transmits 
this motion to the body attached to it. The tension of the ][  ][ rope is just large enough to effect the acceleration of the bo
dy. That ][  ][ which determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the ][  ][ inertial mass of the body." Guided by th
is example, we see that our ][  ][ extension of the principle of relativity implies the necessity of the ][  ][ law of the equal
ity of inertial and gravitational mass. Thus we have ][  ][ obtained a physical interpretation of this law. ][  ][ From our cons
ideration of the accelerated chest we see that a general ][  ][ theory of relativity must yield important results on the laws of
 ][  ][ gravitation. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of the general ][  ][ idea of relativity has supplied the laws sat
isfied by the ][  ][ gravitational field. Before proceeding farther, however, I must warn ][  ][ the reader against a misconcept
ion suggested by these considerations. ][  ][ A gravitational field exists for the man in the chest, despite the ][  ][ fact tha
t there was no such field for the co-ordinate system first ][  ][ chosen. Now we might easily suppose that the existence of a ][
  ][ gravitational field is always only an apparent one. We might also ][  ][ think that, regardless of the kind of gravitationa
l field which may be ][  ][ present, we could always choose another reference-body such that no ][  ][ gravitational field exist
s with reference to it. This is by no means ][  ][ true for all gravitational fields, but only for those of quite special ][  ][
 form. It is, for instance, impossible to choose a body of reference ][  ][ such that, as judged from it, the gravitational fiel
d of the earth (in ][  ][ its entirety) vanishes. ][  ][ We can now appreciate why that argument is not convincing, which we ][ 
 ][ brought forward against the general principle of relativity at theend ][  ][ of Section 18. It is certainly true that the ob
server in the ][  ][ railway carriage experiences a jerk forwards as a result of the ][  ][ application of the brake, and that h
e recognises, in this the ][  ][ non-uniformity of motion (retardation) of the carriage. But he is ][  ][ compelled by nobody to
 refer this jerk to a " real " acceleration ][  ][ (retardation) of the carriage. He might also interpret his experience ][  ][ 
thus: " My body of reference (the carriage) remains permanently at ][  ][ rest. With reference to it, however, there exists (dur
ing the period ][  ][ of application of the brakes) a gravitational field which is directed ][  ][ forwards and which is variabl
e with respect to time. Under the ][  ][ influence of this field, the embankment together with the earth moves ][  ][ non-unifor
mly in such a manner that their original velocity in the ][  ][ backwards direction is continuously reduced." ][  ][ IN WHAT RES
PECTS ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND OF THE ][  ][ SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY UNSATISFACTORY? ][  ][ We have a
lready stated several times that classical mechanics starts ][  ][ out from the following law: Material particles sufficiently f
ar ][  ][ removed from other material particles continue to move uniformly in a ][  ][ straight line or continue in a state of r
est. We have also repeatedly ][  ][ emphasised that this fundamental law can only be valid for bodies of ][  ][ reference K whic
h possess certain unique states of motion, and which ][  ][ are in uniform translational motion relative to each other. Relative
 ][  ][ to other reference-bodies K the law is not valid. Both in classical ][  ][ mechanics and in the special theory of relati
vity we therefore ][  ][ differentiate between reference-bodies K relative to which the ][  ][ recognised " laws of nature " can
 be said to hold, and ][  ][ reference-bodies K relative to which these laws do not hold. ][  ][ But no person whose mode of tho
ught is logical can rest satisfied with ][  ][ this condition of things. He asks : " How does it come that certain ][  ][ refere
nce-bodies (or their states of motion) are given priority over ][  ][ other reference-bodies (or their states of motion) ? What 
is the ][  ][ reason for this Preference? In order to show clearly what I mean by ][  ][ this question, I shall make use of a co
mparison. ][  ][ I am standing in front of a gas range. Standing alongside of each ][  ][ other on the range are two pans so muc
h alike that one may be mistaken ][  ][ for the other. Both are half full of water. I notice that steam is ][  ][ being emitted 
continuously from the one pan, but not from the other. I ][  ][ am surprised at this, even if I have never seen either a gas ran
ge or ][  ][ a pan before. But if I now notice a luminous something of bluish ][  ][ colour under the first pan but not under th
e other, I cease to be ][  ][ astonished, even if I have never before seen a gas flame. For I can ][  ][ only say that this blui
sh something will cause the emission of the ][  ][ steam, or at least possibly it may do so. If, however, I notice the ][  ][ bl
uish something in neither case, and if I observe that the one ][  ][ continuously emits steam whilst the other does not, then I 
shall ][  ][ remain astonished and dissatisfied until I have discovered some ][  ][ circumstance to which I can attribute the di
fferent behaviour of the ][  ][ two pans. ][  ][ Analogously, I seek in vain for a real something in classical ][  ][ mechanics 
(or in the special theory of relativity) to which I can ][  ][ attribute the different behaviour of bodies considered with respe
ct to ][  ][ the reference systems K and K1.*  Newton saw this objection and ][  ][ attempted to invalidate it, but without succ
ess. But E. Mach recognsed ][  ][ it most clearly of all, and because of this objection he claimed that ][  ][ mechanics must be
 placed on a new basis. It can only be got rid of by ][  ][ means of a physics which is conformable to the general principle of 
][  ][ relativity, since the equations of such a theory hold for every body ][  ][ of reference, whatever may be its state of mo
tion. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) The objection is of importance more especially when the state of ][  ][ motion of the reference-b
ody is of such a nature that it does not ][  ][ require any external agency for its maintenance, e.g. in the case when ][  ][ th
e reference-body is rotating uniformly. ][  ][ A FEW INFERENCES FROM THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ The consideratio
ns of Section 20 show that the general principle of ][  ][ relativity puts us in a position to derive properties of the ][  ][ g
ravitational field in a purely theoretical manner. Let us suppose, ][  ][ for instance, that we know the space-time " course " f
or any natural ][  ][ process whatsoever, as regards the manner in which it takes place in ][  ][ the Galileian domain relative 
to a Galileian body of reference K. By ][  ][ means of purely theoretical operations (i.e. simply by calculation) we ][  ][ are 
then able to find how this known natural process appears, as seen ][  ][ from a reference-body K1 which is accelerated relativel
y to K. But ][  ][ since a gravitational field exists with respect to this new body of ][  ][ reference K1, our consideration al
so teaches us how the gravitational ][  ][ field influences the process studied. ][  ][ For example, we learn that a body which 
is in a state of uniform ][  ][ rectilinear motion with respect to K (in accordance with the law of ][  ][ Galilei) is executing
 an accelerated and in general curvilinear motion ][  ][ with respect to the accelerated reference-body K1 (chest). This ][  ][ 
acceleration or curvature corresponds to the influence on the moving ][  ][ body of the gravitational field prevailing relativel
y to K. It is ][  ][ known that a gravitational field influences the movement of bodies in ][  ][ this way, so that our consider
ation supplies us with nothing ][  ][ essentially new. ][  ][ However, we obtain a new result of fundamental importance when we 
][  ][ carry out the analogous consideration for a ray of light. With respect ][  ][ to the Galileian reference-body K, such a r
ay of light is transmitted ][  ][ rectilinearly with the velocity c. It can easily be shown that the ][  ][ path of the same ray
 of light is no longer a straight line when we ][  ][ consider it with reference to the accelerated chest (reference-body ][  ][
 K1). From this we conclude, that, in general, rays of light are ][  ][ propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields. In two
 respects this ][  ][ result is of great importance. ][  ][ In the first place, it can be compared with the reality. Although a 
][  ][ detailed examination of the question shows that the curvature of light ][  ][ rays required by the general theory of rela
tivity is only exceedingly ][  ][ small for the gravitational fields at our disposal in practice, its ][  ][ estimated magnitude
 for light rays passing the sun at grazing ][  ][ incidence is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This ought to manifest ][  ][ it
self in the following way. As seen from the earth, certain fixed ][  ][ stars appear to be in the neighbourhood of the sun, and 
are thus ][  ][ capable of observation during a total eclipse of the sun. At such ][  ][ times, these stars ought to appear to b
e displaced outwards from the ][  ][ sun by an amount indicated above, as compared with their apparent ][  ][ position in the sk
y when the sun is situated at another part of the ][  ][ heavens. The examination of the correctness or otherwise of this ][  ][
 deduction is a problem of the greatest importance, the early solution ][  ][ of which is to be expected of astronomers.[2]* ][ 
 ][ In the second place our result shows that, according to the general ][  ][ theory of relativity, the law of the constancy of
 the velocity of ][  ][ light in vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental ][  ][ assumptions in the special theory of
 relativity and to which we have ][  ][ already frequently referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A ][  ][ curvature of 
rays of light can only take place when the velocity of ][  ][ propagation of light varies with position. Now we might think that
 as ][  ][ a consequence of this, the special theory of relativity and with it ][  ][ the whole theory of relativity would be la
id in the dust. But in ][  ][ reality this is not the case. We can only conclude that the special ][  ][ theory of relativity ca
nnot claim an unlinlited domain of validity ; ][  ][ its results hold only so long as we are able to disregard the ][  ][ influe
nces of gravitational fields on the phenomena (e.g. of light). ][  ][ Since it has often been contended by opponents of the theo
ry of ][  ][ relativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown by the ][  ][ general theory of relativity, it is pe
rhaps advisable to make the ][  ][ facts of the case clearer by means of an appropriate comparison. ][  ][ Before the developmen
t of electrodynamics the laws of electrostatics ][  ][ were looked upon as the laws of electricity. At the present time we ][  ]
[ know that electric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic ][  ][ considerations only for the case, which is never 
strictly realised, in ][  ][ which the electrical masses are quite at rest relatively to each ][  ][ other, and to the co-ordina
te system. Should we be justified in saying ][  ][ that for this reason electrostatics is overthrown by the ][  ][ field-equatio
ns of Maxwell in electrodynamics ? Not in the least. ][  ][ Electrostatics is contained in electrodynamics as a limiting case ; 
][  ][ the laws of the latter lead directly to those of the former for the ][  ][ case in which the fields are invariable with r
egard to time. No fairer ][  ][ destiny could be allotted to any physical theory, than that it should ][  ][ of itself point out
 the way to the introduction of a more ][  ][ comprehensive theory, in which it lives on as a limiting case. ][  ][ In the examp
le of the transmission of light just dealt with, we have ][  ][ seen that the general theory of relativity enables us to derive 
][  ][ theoretically the influence of a gravitational field on the course of ][  ][ natural processes, the Iaws of which are alr
eady known when a ][  ][ gravitational field is absent. But the most attractive problem, to the ][  ][ solution of which the gen
eral theory of relativity supplies the key, ][  ][ concerns the investigation of the laws satisfied by the gravitational ][  ][ 
field itself. Let us consider this for a moment. ][  ][ We are acquainted with space-time domains which behave (approximately) ]
[  ][ in a " Galileian " fashion under suitable choice of reference-body, ][  ][ i.e. domains in which gravitational fields are 
absent. If we now refer ][  ][ such a domain to a reference-body K1 possessing any kind of motion, ][  ][ then relative to K1 th
ere exists a gravitational field which is ][  ][ variable with respect to space and time.[3]**  The character of this ][  ][ fie
ld will of course depend on the motion chosen for K1. According to ][  ][ the general theory of relativity, the general law of t
he gravitational ][  ][ field must be satisfied for all gravitational fields obtainable in ][  ][ this way. Even though by no me
ans all gravitationial fields can be ][  ][ produced in this way, yet we may entertain the hope that the general ][  ][ law of g
ravitation will be derivable from such gravitational fields of ][  ][ a special kind. This hope has been realised in the most be
autiful ][  ][ manner. But between the clear vision of this goal and its actual ][  ][ realisation it was necessary to surmount 
a serious difficulty, and as ][  ][ this lies deep at the root of things, I dare not withhold it from the ][  ][ reader. We requ
ire to extend our ideas of the space-time continuum ][  ][ still farther. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) By means of the star photogra
phs of two expeditions equipped by ][  ][ a Joint Committee of the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies, the ][  ][ existence 
of the deflection of light demanded by theory was first ][  ][ confirmed during the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. (Cf. Append
ix ][  ][ III.) ][  ][ **) This follows from a generalisation of the discussion in ][  ][ Section 20 ][  ][ BEHAVIOUR OF CLOCKS 
AND MEASURING-RODS ON A ROTATING BODY OF REFERENCE ][  ][ Hitherto I have purposely refrained from speaking about the physical ]
[  ][ interpretation of space- and time-data in the case of the general ][  ][ theory of relativity. As a consequence, I am guil
ty of a certain ][  ][ slovenliness of treatment, which, as we know from the special theory ][  ][ of relativity, is far from be
ing unimportant and pardonable. It is now ][  ][ high time that we remedy this defect; but I would mention at the ][  ][ outset,
 that this matter lays no small claims on the patience and on ][  ][ the power of abstraction of the reader. ][  ][ We start off
 again from quite special cases, which we have frequently ][  ][ used before. Let us consider a space time domain in which no ][
  ][ gravitational field exists relative to a reference-body K whose state ][  ][ of motion has been suitably chosen. K is then 
a Galileian ][  ][ reference-body as regards the domain considered, and the results of ][  ][ the special theory of relativity h
old relative to K. Let us supposse ][  ][ the same domain referred to a second body of reference K1, which is ][  ][ rotating un
iformly with respect to K. In order to fix our ideas, we ][  ][ shall imagine K1 to be in the form of a plane circular disc, whi
ch ][  ][ rotates uniformly in its own plane about its centre. An observer who ][  ][ is sitting eccentrically on the disc K1 is
 sensible of a force which ][  ][ acts outwards in a radial direction, and which would be interpreted as ][  ][ an effect of ine
rtia (centrifugal force) by an observer who was at ][  ][ rest with respect to the original reference-body K. But the observer ]
[  ][ on the disc may regard his disc as a reference-body which is " at rest ][  ][ " ; on the basis of the general principle of
 relativity he is ][  ][ justified in doing this. The force acting on himself, and in fact on ][  ][ all other bodies which are 
at rest relative to the disc, he regards as ][  ][ the effect of a gravitational field. Nevertheless, the ][  ][ space-distribut
ion of this gravitational field is of a kind that would ][  ][ not be possible on Newton's theory of gravitation.* But since the
 ][  ][ observer believes in the general theory of relativity, this does not ][  ][ disturb him; he is quite in the right when h
e believes that a general ][  ][ law of gravitation can be formulated- a law which not only explains ][  ][ the motion of the st
ars correctly, but also the field of force ][  ][ experienced by himself. ][  ][ The observer performs experiments on his circul
ar disc with clocks and ][  ][ measuring-rods. In doing so, it is his intention to arrive at exact ][  ][ definitions for the si
gnification of time- and space-data with ][  ][ reference to the circular disc K1, these definitions being based on ][  ][ his o
bservations. What will be his experience in this enterprise ? ][  ][ To start with, he places one of two identically constructed
 clocks at ][  ][ the centre of the circular disc, and the other on the edge of the ][  ][ disc, so that they are at rest relati
ve to it. We now ask ourselves ][  ][ whether both clocks go at the same rate from the standpoint of the ][  ][ non-rotating Gal
ileian reference-body K. As judged from this body, the ][  ][ clock at the centre of the disc has no velocity, whereas the clock
 at ][  ][ the edge of the disc is in motion relative to K in consequence of the ][  ][ rotation. According to a result obtained
 in Section 12, it follows ][  ][ that the latter clock goes at a rate permanently slower than that of ][  ][ the clock at the c
entre of the circular disc, i.e. as observed from K. ][  ][ It is obvious that the same effect would be noted by an observer who
m ][  ][ we will imagine sitting alongside his clock at the centre of the ][  ][ circular disc. Thus on our circular disc, or, t
o make the case more ][  ][ general, in every gravitational field, a clock will go more quickly or ][  ][ less quickly, accordin
g to the position in which the clock is situated ][  ][ (at rest). For this reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable ][ 
 ][ definition of time with the aid of clocks which are arranged at rest ][  ][ with respect to the body of reference. A similar
 difficulty presents ][  ][ itself when we attempt to apply our earlier definition of simultaneity ][  ][ in such a case, but I 
do not wish to go any farther into this ][  ][ question. ][  ][ Moreover, at this stage the definition of the space co-ordinates
 also ][  ][ presents insurmountable difficulties. If the observer applies his ][  ][ standard measuring-rod (a rod which is sho
rt as compared with the ][  ][ radius of the disc) tangentially to the edge of the disc, then, as ][  ][ judged from the Galilei
an system, the length of this rod will be less ][  ][ than I, since, according to Section 12, moving bodies suffer a ][  ][ shor
tening in the direction of the motion. On the other hand, the ][  ][ measaring-rod will not experience a shortening in length, a
s judged ][  ][ from K, if it is applied to the disc in the direction of the radius. ][  ][ If, then, the observer first measure
s the circumference of the disc ][  ][ with his measuring-rod and then the diameter of the disc, on dividing ][  ][ the one by t
he other, he will not obtain as quotient the familiar ][  ][ number p = 3.14 . . ., but a larger number,[4]** whereas of course,
 ][  ][ for a disc which is at rest with respect to K, this operation would ][  ][ yield p exactly. This proves that the proposi
tions of Euclidean ][  ][ geometry cannot hold exactly on the rotating disc, nor in general in a ][  ][ gravitational field, at 
least if we attribute the length I to the rod ][  ][ in all positions and in every orientation. Hence the idea of a ][  ][ strai
ght line also loses its meaning. We are therefore not in a ][  ][ position to define exactly the co-ordinates x, y, z relative t
o the ][  ][ disc by means of the method used in discussing the special theory, and ][  ][ as long as the co- ordinates and time
s of events have not been ][  ][ defined, we cannot assign an exact meaning to the natural laws in ][  ][ which these occur. ][ 
 ][ Thus all our previous conclusions based on general relativity would ][  ][ appear to be called in question. In reality we mu
st make a subtle ][  ][ detour in order to be able to apply the postulate of general ][  ][ relativity exactly. I shall prepare 
the reader for this in the ][  ][ following paragraphs. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) The field disappears at the centre of the disc 
and increases ][  ][ proportionally to the distance from the centre as we proceed outwards. ][  ][ **) Throughout this considera
tion we have to use the Galileian ][  ][ (non-rotating) system K as reference-body, since we may only assume ][  ][ the validity
 of the results of the special theory of relativity ][  ][ relative to K (relative to K1 a gravitational field prevails). ][  ][
 EUCLIDEAN AND NON-EUCLIDEAN CONTINUUM ][  ][ The surface of a marble table is spread out in front of me. I can get ][  ][ from 
any one point on this table to any other point by passing ][  ][ continuously from one point to a " neighbouring " one, and repe
ating ][  ][ this process a (large) number of times, or, in other words, by going ][  ][ from point to point without executing "
jumps." I am sure the reader ][  ][ will appreciate with sufficient clearness what I mean here by " ][  ][ neighbouring " and by
 " jumps " (if he is not too pedantic). We ][  ][ express this property of the surface by describing the latter as a ][  ][ cont
inuum. ][  ][ Let us now imagine that a large number of little rods of equal length ][  ][ have been made, their lengths being s
mall compared with the dimensions ][  ][ of the marble slab. When I say they are of equal length, I mean that ][  ][ one can be 
laid on any other without the ends overlapping. We next lay ][  ][ four of these little rods on the marble slab so that they con
stitute a ][  ][ quadrilateral figure (a square), the diagonals of which are equally ][  ][ long. To ensure the equality of the 
diagonals, we make use of a little ][  ][ testing-rod. To this square we add similar ones, each of which has one ][  ][ rod in c
ommon with the first. We proceed in like manner with each of ][  ][ these squares until finally the whole marble slab is laid ou
t with ][  ][ squares. The arrangement is such, that each side of a square belongs ][  ][ to two squares and each corner to four
 squares. ][  ][ It is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this business without ][  ][ getting into the greatest difficult
ies. We only need to think of the ][  ][ following. If at any moment three squares meet at a corner, then two ][  ][ sides of th
e fourth square are already laid, and, as a consequence, ][  ][ the arrangement of the remaining two sides of the square is alre
ady ][  ][ completely determined. But I am now no longer able to adjust the ][  ][ quadrilateral so that its diagonals may be eq
ual. If they are equal of ][  ][ their own accord, then this is an especial favour of the marble slab ][  ][ and of the little r
ods, about which I can only be thankfully ][  ][ surprised. We must experience many such surprises if the construction ][  ][ is
 to be successful. ][  ][ If everything has really gone smoothly, then I say that the points of ][  ][ the marble slab constitut
e a Euclidean continuum with respect to the ][  ][ little rod, which has been used as a " distance " (line-interval). By ][  ][ 
choosing one corner of a square as " origin" I can characterise every ][  ][ other corner of a square with reference to this ori
gin by means of two ][  ][ numbers. I only need state how many rods I must pass over when, ][  ][ starting from the origin, I pr
oceed towards the " right " and then " ][  ][ upwards," in order to arrive at the corner of the square under ][  ][ consideratio
n. These two numbers are then the " Cartesian co-ordinates ][  ][ " of this corner with reference to the " Cartesian co-ordinate
 system" ][  ][ which is determined by the arrangement of little rods. ][  ][ By making use of the following modification of thi
s abstract ][  ][ experiment, we recognise that there must also be cases in which the ][  ][ experiment would be unsuccessful. W
e shall suppose that the rods " ][  ][ expand " by in amount proportional to the increase of temperature. We ][  ][ heat the cen
tral part of the marble slab, but not the periphery, in ][  ][ which case two of our little rods can still be brought into ][  ]
[ coincidence at every position on the table. But our construction of ][  ][ squares must necessarily come into disorder during 
the heating, ][  ][ because the little rods on the central region of the table expand, ][  ][ whereas those on the outer part do
 not. ][  ][ With reference to our little rods -- defined as unit lengths -- the ][  ][ marble slab is no longer a Euclidean con
tinuum, and we are also no ][  ][ longer in the position of defining Cartesian co-ordinates directly ][  ][ with their aid, sinc
e the above construction can no longer be carried ][  ][ out. But since there are other things which are not influenced in a ][ 
 ][ similar manner to the little rods (or perhaps not at all) by the ][  ][ temperature of the table, it is possible quite natur
ally to maintain ][  ][ the point of view that the marble slab is a " Euclidean continuum." ][  ][ This can be done in a satisfa
ctory manner by making a more subtle ][  ][ stipulation about the measurement or the comparison of lengths. ][  ][ But if rods o
f every kind (i.e. of every material) were to behave in ][  ][ the same way as regards the influence of temperature when they ar
e on ][  ][ the variably heated marble slab, and if we had no other means of ][  ][ detecting the effect of temperature than the
 geometrical behaviour of ][  ][ our rods in experiments analogous to the one described above, then our ][  ][ best plan would b
e to assign the distance one to two points on the ][  ][ slab, provided that the ends of one of our rods could be made to ][  ][
 coincide with these two points ; for how else should we define the ][  ][ distance without our proceeding being in the highest 
measure grossly ][  ][ arbitrary ? The method of Cartesian coordinates must then be ][  ][ discarded, and replaced by another wh
ich does not assume the validity ][  ][ of Euclidean geometry for rigid bodies.*  The reader will notice ][  ][ that the situati
on depicted here corresponds to the one brought about ][  ][ by the general postitlate of relativity (Section 23). ][  ][   Note
s ][  ][ *) Mathematicians have been confronted with our problem in the ][  ][ following form. If we are given a surface (e.g. a
n ellipsoid) in ][  ][ Euclidean three-dimensional space, then there exists for this surface ][  ][ a two-dimensional geometry, 
just as much as for a plane surface. Gauss ][  ][ undertook the task of treating this two-dimensional geometry from ][  ][ first
 principles, without making use of the fact that the surface ][  ][ belongs to a Euclidean continuum of three dimensions. If we 
imagine ][  ][ constructions to be made with rigid rods in the surface (similar to ][  ][ that above with the marble slab), we s
hould find that different laws ][  ][ hold for these from those resulting on the basis of Euclidean plane ][  ][ geometry. The s
urface is not a Euclidean continuum with respect to the ][  ][ rods, and we cannot define Cartesian co-ordinates in the surface.
 ][  ][ Gauss indicated the principles according to which we can treat the ][  ][ geometrical relationships in the surface, and 
thus pointed out the way ][  ][ to the method of Riemman of treating multi-dimensional, non-Euclidean ][  ][ continuum. Thus it 
is that mathematicians long ago solved the formal ][  ][ problems to which we are led by the general postulate of relativity. ][
  ][ GAUSSIAN CO-ORDINATES ][  ][ According to Gauss, this combined analytical and geometrical mode of ][  ][ handling the probl
em can be arrived at in the following way. We ][  ][ imagine a system of arbitrary curves (see Fig. 4) drawn on the surface ][  
][ of the table. These we designate as u-curves, and we indicate each of ][  ][ them by means of a number. The Curves u= 1, u= 2
 and u= 3 are drawn in ][  ][ the diagram. Between the curves u= 1 and u= 2 we must imagine an ][  ][ infinitely large number to
 be drawn, all of which correspond to real ][  ][ numbers lying between 1 and 2. fig. 04 We have then a system of ][  ][ u-curve
s, and this "infinitely dense" system covers the whole surface ][  ][ of the table. These u-curves must not intersect each other
, and ][  ][ through each point of the surface one and only one curve must pass. ][  ][ Thus a perfectly definite value of u bel
ongs to every point on the ][  ][ surface of the marble slab. In like manner we imagine a system of ][  ][ v-curves drawn on the
 surface. These satisfy the same conditions as ][  ][ the u-curves, they are provided with numbers in a corresponding ][  ][ man
ner, and they may likewise be of arbitrary shape. It follows that a ][  ][ value of u and a value of v belong to every point on 
the surface of ][  ][ the table. We call these two numbers the co-ordinates of the surface ][  ][ of the table (Gaussian co-ordi
nates). For example, the point P in the ][  ][ diagram has the Gaussian co-ordinates u= 3, v= 1. Two neighbouring ][  ][ points 
P and P1 on the surface then correspond to the co-ordinates ][  ][                        P:       u,v ][  ][                   
     P1:     u + du, v + dv, ][  ][ where du and dv signify very small numbers. In a similar manner we may ][  ][ indicate the d
istance (line-interval) between P and P1, as measured ][  ][ with a little rod, by means of the very small number ds. Then ][  ]
[ according to Gauss we have ][  ][                 ds2 = g[11]du2 + 2g[12]dudv = g[22]dv2 ][  ][ where g[11], g[12], g[22], are
 magnitudes which depend in a perfectly ][  ][ definite way on u and v. The magnitudes g[11], g[12] and g[22], ][  ][ determine 
the behaviour of the rods relative to the u-curves and ][  ][ v-curves, and thus also relative to the surface of the table. For 
the ][  ][ case in which the points of the surface considered form a Euclidean ][  ][ continuum with reference to the measuring-
rods, but only in this case, ][  ][ it is possible to draw the u-curves and v-curves and to attach numbers ][  ][ to them, in su
ch a manner, that we simply have : ][  ][                            ds2 = du2 + dv2 ][  ][ Under these conditions, the u-curves
 and v-curves are straight lines ][  ][ in the sense of Euclidean geometry, and they are perpendicular to each ][  ][ other. Her
e the Gaussian coordinates are samply Cartesian ones. It is ][  ][ clear that Gauss co-ordinates are nothing more than an associ
ation of ][  ][ two sets of numbers with the points of the surface considered, of such ][  ][ a nature that numerical values dif
fering very slightly from each other ][  ][ are associated with neighbouring points " in space." ][  ][ So far, these considerat
ions hold for a continuum of two dimensions. ][  ][ But the Gaussian method can be applied also to a continuum of three, ][  ][ 
four or more dimensions. If, for instance, a continuum of four ][  ][ dimensions be supposed available, we may represent it in t
he following ][  ][ way. With every point of the continuum, we associate arbitrarily four ][  ][ numbers, x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4]
, which are known as " co-ordinates." ][  ][ Adjacent points correspond to adjacent values of the coordinates. If a ][  ][ dista
nce ds is associated with the adjacent points P and P1, this ][  ][ distance being measurable and well defined from a physical p
oint of ][  ][ view, then the following formula holds: ][  ][ ds2 = g[11]dx[1]^2 + 2g[12]dx[1]dx[2] . . . . g[44]dx[4]^2, ][  ][
 where the magnitudes g[11], etc., have values which vary with the ][  ][ position in the continuum. Only when the continuum is 
a Euclidean one ][  ][ is it possible to associate the co-ordinates x[1] . . x[4]. with the ][  ][ points of the continuum so th
at we have simply ][  ][ ds2 = dx[1]^2 + dx[2]^2 + dx[3]^2 + dx[4]^2. ][  ][ In this case relations hold in the four-dimensional
 continuum which ][  ][ are analogous to those holding in our three-dimensional measurements. ][  ][ However, the Gauss treatmen
t for ds2 which we have given above is not ][  ][ always possible. It is only possible when sufficiently small regions ][  ][ of
 the continuum under consideration may be regarded as Euclidean ][  ][ continua. For example, this obviously holds in the case o
f the marble ][  ][ slab of the table and local variation of temperature. The temperature ][  ][ is practically constant for a s
mall part of the slab, and thus the ][  ][ geometrical behaviour of the rods is almost as it ought to be ][  ][ according to the
 rules of Euclidean geometry. Hence the imperfections ][  ][ of the construction of squares in the previous section do not show 
][  ][ themselves clearly until this construction is extended over a ][  ][ considerable portion of the surface of the table. ][
  ][ We can sum this up as follows: Gauss invented a method for the ][  ][ mathematical treatment of continua in general, in whi
ch " ][  ][ size-relations " (" distances " between neighbouring points) are ][  ][ defined. To every point of a continuum are a
ssigned as many numbers ][  ][ (Gaussian coordinates) as the continuum has dimensions. This is done ][  ][ in such a way, that o
nly one meaning can be attached to the ][  ][ assignment, and that numbers (Gaussian coordinates) which differ by an ][  ][ inde
finitely small amount are assigned to adjacent points. The ][  ][ Gaussian coordinate system is a logical generalisation of the 
][  ][ Cartesian co-ordinate system. It is also applicable to non-Euclidean ][  ][ continua, but only when, with respect to the 
defined "size" or ][  ][ "distance," small parts of the continuum under consideration behave ][  ][ more nearly like a Euclidean
 system, the smaller the part of the ][  ][ continuum under our notice. ][  ][ THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM OF THE SPEICAL THEORY OF
 RELATIVITY CONSIDERED AS A ][  ][ EUCLIDEAN CONTINUUM ][  ][ We are now in a position to formulate more exactly the idea of ][ 
 ][ Minkowski, which was only vaguely indicated in Section 17. In ][  ][ accordance with the special theory of relativity, certa
in co-ordinate ][  ][ systems are given preference for the description of the ][  ][ four-dimensional, space-time continuum. We 
called these " Galileian ][  ][ co-ordinate systems." For these systems, the four co-ordinates x, y, ][  ][ z, t, which determin
e an event or -- in other words, a point of the ][  ][ four-dimensional continuum -- are defined physically in a simple ][  ][ m
anner, as set forth in detail in the first part of this book. For the ][  ][ transition from one Galileian system to another, wh
ich is moving ][  ][ uniformly with reference to the first, the equations of the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation are valid. These 
last form the basis for the derivation ][  ][ of deductions from the special theory of relativity, and in themselves ][  ][ they
 are nothing more than the expression of the universal validity of ][  ][ the law of transmission of light for all Galileian sys
tems of ][  ][ reference. ][  ][ Minkowski found that the Lorentz transformations satisfy the following ][  ][ simple conditions
. Let us consider two neighbouring events, the ][  ][ relative position of which in the four-dimensional continuum is given ][  
][ with respect to a Galileian reference-body K by the space co-ordinate ][  ][ differences dx, dy, dz and the time-difference d
t. With reference to a ][  ][ second Galileian system we shall suppose that the corresponding ][  ][ differences for these two e
vents are dx1, dy1, dz1, dt1. Then these ][  ][ magnitudes always fulfil the condition* ][  ][      dx2 + dy2 + dz2 - c^2dt2 = d
x1 2 + dy1 2 + dz1 2 - c^2dt1 2. ][  ][ The validity of the Lorentz transformation follows from this ][  ][ condition. We can ex
press this as follows: The magnitude ][  ][                    ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 - c^2dt2, ][  ][ which belongs to two adjac
ent points of the four-dimensional ][  ][ space-time continuum, has the same value for all selected (Galileian) ][  ][ reference
-bodies. If we replace x, y, z, sq. rt. -I . ct , by x[1], ][  ][ x[2], x[3], x[4], we also obtaill the result that ][  ][      
        ds2 = dx[1]^2 + dx[2]^2 + dx[3]^2 + dx[4]^2. ][  ][ is independent of the choice of the body of reference. We call the ]
[  ][ magnitude ds the " distance " apart of the two events or ][  ][ four-dimensional points. ][  ][ Thus, if we choose as time
-variable the imaginary variable sq. rt. -I ][  ][ . ct instead of the real quantity t, we can regard the space-time ][  ][ cont
intium -- accordance with the special theory of relativity -- as a ][  ][ ", Euclidean " four-dimensional continuum, a result wh
ich follows from ][  ][ the considerations of the preceding section. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) Cf. Appendixes I and 2. The relati
ons which are derived ][  ][ there for the co-ordlnates themselves are valid also for co-ordinate ][  ][ differences, and thus a
lso for co-ordinate differentials (indefinitely ][  ][ small differences). ][  ][ THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM OF THE GENERAL THEORY
 OF REALTIIVTY IS NOT A ][  ][ ECULIDEAN CONTINUUM ][  ][ In the first part of this book we were able to make use of space-time 
][  ][ co-ordinates which allowed of a simple and direct physical ][  ][ interpretation, and which, according to Section 26, can
 be regarded ][  ][ as four-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. This was possible on the ][  ][ basis of the law of the constanc
y of the velocity of tight. But ][  ][ according to Section 21 the general theory of relativity cannot ][  ][ retain this law. O
n the contrary, we arrived at the result that ][  ][ according to this latter theory the velocity of light must always ][  ][ de
pend on the co-ordinates when a gravitational field is present. In ][  ][ connection with a specific illustration in Section 23,
 we found ][  ][ that the presence of a gravitational field invalidates the definition ][  ][ of the coordinates and the ifine, 
which led us to our objective in the ][  ][ special theory of relativity. ][  ][ In view of the resuIts of these considerations 
we are led to the ][  ][ conviction that, according to the general principle of relativity, the ][  ][ space-time continuum cann
ot be regarded as a Euclidean one, but that ][  ][ here we have the general case, corresponding to the marble slab with ][  ][ l
ocal variations of temperature, and with which we made acquaintance ][  ][ as an example of a two-dimensional continuum. Just as
 it was there ][  ][ impossible to construct a Cartesian co-ordinate system from equal ][  ][ rods, so here it is impossible to 
build up a system (reference-body) ][  ][ from rigid bodies and clocks, which shall be of such a nature that ][  ][ measuring-ro
ds and clocks, arranged rigidly with respect to one ][  ][ another, shaIll indicate position and time directly. Such was the ][ 
 ][ essence of the difficulty with which we were confronted in Section ][  ][ 23. ][  ][ But the considerations of Sections 25 a
nd 26 show us the way to ][  ][ surmount this difficulty. We refer the fourdimensional space-time ][  ][ continuum in an arbitra
ry manner to Gauss co-ordinates. We assign to ][  ][ every point of the continuum (event) four numbers, x[1], x[2], x[3], ][  ][
 x[4] (co-ordinates), which have not the least direct physical ][  ][ significance, but only serve the purpose of numbering the 
points of ][  ][ the continuum in a definite but arbitrary manner. This arrangement ][  ][ does not even need to be of such a ki
nd that we must regard x[1], ][  ][ x[2], x[3], as "space" co-ordinates and x[4], as a " time " ][  ][ co-ordinate. ][  ][ The r
eader may think that such a description of the world would be ][  ][ quite inadequate. What does it mean to assign to an event t
he ][  ][ particular co-ordinates x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], if in themselves these ][  ][ co-ordinates have no significance ? More
 careful consideration shows, ][  ][ however, that this anxiety is unfounded. Let us consider, for ][  ][ instance, a material p
oint with any kind of motion. If this point had ][  ][ only a momentary existence without duration, then it would to ][  ][ desc
ribed in space-time by a single system of values x[1], x[2], x[3], ][  ][ x[4]. Thus its permanent existence must be characteris
ed by an ][  ][ infinitely large number of such systems of values, the co-ordinate ][  ][ values of which are so close together 
as to give continuity; ][  ][ corresponding to the material point, we thus have a (uni-dimensional) ][  ][ line in the four-dime
nsional continuum. In the same way, any such ][  ][ lines in our continuum correspond to many points in motion. The only ][  ][ 
statements having regard to these points which can claim a physical ][  ][ existence are in reality the statements about their e
ncounters. In our ][  ][ mathematical treatment, such an encounter is expressed in the fact ][  ][ that the two lines which repr
esent the motions of the points in ][  ][ question have a particular system of co-ordinate values, x[1], x[2], ][  ][ x[3], x[4]
, in common. After mature consideration the reader will ][  ][ doubtless admit that in reality such encounters constitute the on
ly ][  ][ actual evidence of a time-space nature with which we meet in physical ][  ][ statements. ][  ][ When we were describin
g the motion of a material point relative to a ][  ][ body of reference, we stated nothing more than the encounters of this ][  
][ point with particular points of the reference-body. We can also ][  ][ determine the corresponding values of the time by the 
observation of ][  ][ encounters of the body with clocks, in conjunction with the ][  ][ observation of the encounter of the han
ds of clocks with particular ][  ][ points on the dials. It is just the same in the case of ][  ][ space-measurements by means o
f measuring-rods, as a litttle ][  ][ consideration will show. ][  ][ The following statements hold generally : Every physical d
escription ][  ][ resolves itself into a number of statements, each of which refers to ][  ][ the space-time coincidence of two 
events A and B. In terms of Gaussian ][  ][ co-ordinates, every such statement is expressed by the agreement of ][  ][ their fou
r co-ordinates x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4]. Thus in reality, the ][  ][ description of the time-space continuum by means of Gauss co-
ordinates ][  ][ completely replaces the description with the aid of a body of ][  ][ reference, without suffering from the defe
cts of the latter mode of ][  ][ description; it is not tied down to the Euclidean character of the ][  ][ continuum which has t
o be represented. ][  ][ EXACT FORMULATION OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ We are now in a position to replace the
 pro. visional formulation of ][  ][ the general principle of relativity given in Section 18 by an exact ][  ][ formulation. The
 form there used, "All bodies of reference K, K1, ][  ][ etc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena ][  ][ (f
ormulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their ][  ][ state of motion," cannot be maintained, because the use 
of rigid ][  ][ reference-bodies, in the sense of the method followed in the special ][  ][ theory of relativity, is in general 
not possible in space-time ][  ][ description. The Gauss co-ordinate system has to take the place of the ][  ][ body of referenc
e. The following statement corresponds to the ][  ][ fundamental idea of the general principle of relativity: "All Gaussian ][  
][ co-ordinate systems are essentially equivalent for the formulation of ][  ][ the general laws of nature." ][  ][ We can state
 this general principle of relativity in still another ][  ][ form, which renders it yet more clearly intelligible than it is wh
en ][  ][ in the form of the natural extension of the special principle of ][  ][ relativity. According to the special theory of
 relativity, the ][  ][ equations which express the general laws of nature pass over into ][  ][ equations of the same form when
, by making use of the Lorentz ][  ][ transformation, we replace the space-time variables x, y, z, t, of a ][  ][ (Galileian) re
ference-body K by the space-time variables x1, y1, z1, ][  ][ t1, of a new reference-body K1. According to the general theory of
 ][  ][ relativity, on the other hand, by application of arbitrary ][  ][ substitutions of the Gauss variables x[1], x[2], x[3],
 x[4], the ][  ][ equations must pass over into equations of the same form; for every ][  ][ transformation (not only the Lorent
z transformation) corresponds to ][  ][ the transition of one Gauss co-ordinate system into another. ][  ][ If we desire to adhe
re to our "old-time" three-dimensional view of ][  ][ things, then we can characterise the development which is being ][  ][ und
ergone by the fundamental idea of the general theory of relativity ][  ][ as follows : The special theory of relativity has refe
rence to ][  ][ Galileian domains, i.e. to those in which no gravitational field ][  ][ exists. In this connection a Galileian r
eference-body serves as body ][  ][ of reference, i.e. a rigid body the state of motion of which is so ][  ][ chosen that the Ga
lileian law of the uniform rectilinear motion of ][  ][ "isolated" material points holds relatively to it. ][  ][ Certain consid
erations suggest that we should refer the same Galileian ][  ][ domains to non-Galileian reference-bodies also. A gravitational 
field ][  ][ of a special kind is then present with respect to these bodies (cf. ][  ][ Sections 20 and 23). ][  ][ In gravitati
onal fields there are no such things as rigid bodies with ][  ][ Euclidean properties; thus the fictitious rigid body of referen
ce is ][  ][ of no avail in the general theory of relativity. The motion of clocks ][  ][ is also influenced by gravitational fi
elds, and in such a way that a ][  ][ physical definition of time which is made directly with the aid of ][  ][ clocks has by no
 means the same degree of plausibility as in the ][  ][ special theory of relativity. ][  ][ For this reason non-rigid reference
-bodies are used, which are as a ][  ][ whole not only moving in any way whatsoever, but which also suffer ][  ][ alterations in
 form ad lib. during their motion. Clocks, for which the ][  ][ law of motion is of any kind, however irregular, serve for the ]
[  ][ definition of time. We have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a ][  ][ point on the non-rigid reference-body. These
 clocks satisfy only the ][  ][ one condition, that the "readings" which are observed simultaneously ][  ][ on adjacent clocks (
in space) differ from each other by an ][  ][ indefinitely small amount. This non-rigid reference-body, which might ][  ][ appro
priately be termed a "reference-mollusc", is in the main ][  ][ equivalent to a Gaussian four-dimensional co-ordinate system cho
sen ][  ][ arbitrarily. That which gives the "mollusc" a certain ][  ][ comprehensibility as compared with the Gauss co-ordinate
 system is the ][  ][ (really unjustified) formal retention of the separate existence of the ][  ][ space co-ordinates as oppose
d to the time co-ordinate. Every point on ][  ][ the mollusc is treated as a space-point, and every material point ][  ][ which 
is at rest relatively to it as at rest, so long as the mollusc ][  ][ is considered as reference-body. The general principle of 
relativity ][  ][ requires that all these molluscs can be used as reference-bodies with ][  ][ equal right and equal success in 
the formulation of the general laws ][  ][ of nature; the laws themselves must be quite independent of the choice ][  ][ of moll
usc. ][  ][ The great power possessed by the general principle of relativity lies ][  ][ in the comprehensive limitation which i
s imposed on the laws of nature ][  ][ in consequence of what we have seen above. ][  ][ THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF GRAVITAT
ION ON THE BASIS OF THE GENERAL ][  ][ PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ If the reader has followed all our previous considerations
, he will ][  ][ have no further difficulty in understanding the methods leading to the ][  ][ solution of the problem of gravit
ation. ][  ][ We start off on a consideration of a Galileian domain, i.e. a domain ][  ][ in which there is no gravitational fie
ld relative to the Galileian ][  ][ reference-body K. The behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks with ][  ][ reference to K is k
nown from the special theory of relativity, ][  ][ likewise the behaviour of "isolated" material points; the latter move ][  ][ 
uniformly and in straight lines. ][  ][ Now let us refer this domain to a random Gauss coordinate system or to ][  ][ a "mollusc
" as reference-body K1. Then with respect to K1 there is a ][  ][ gravitational field G (of a particular kind). We learn the beh
aviour ][  ][ of measuring-rods and clocks and also of freely-moving material points ][  ][ with reference to K1 simply by mathe
matical transformation. We ][  ][ interpret this behaviour as the behaviour of measuring-rods, docks and ][  ][ material points 
tinder the influence of the gravitational field G. ][  ][ Hereupon we introduce a hypothesis: that the influence of the ][  ][ g
ravitational field on measuringrods, clocks and freely-moving ][  ][ material points continues to take place according to the sa
me laws, ][  ][ even in the case where the prevailing gravitational field is not ][  ][ derivable from the Galfleian special car
e, simply by means of a ][  ][ transformation of co-ordinates. ][  ][ The next step is to investigate the space-time behaviour o
f the ][  ][ gravitational field G, which was derived from the Galileian special ][  ][ case simply by transformation of the coo
rdinates. This behaviour is ][  ][ formulated in a law, which is always valid, no matter how the ][  ][ reference-body (mollusc)
 used in the description may be chosen. ][  ][ This law is not yet the general law of the gravitational field, since ][  ][ the 
gravitational field under consideration is of a special kind. In ][  ][ order to find out the general law-of-field of gravitatio
n we still ][  ][ require to obtain a generalisation of the law as found above. This can ][  ][ be obtained without caprice, how
ever, by taking into consideration the ][  ][ following demands: ][  ][ (a) The required generalisation must likewise satisfy th
e general ][  ][ postulate of relativity. ][  ][ (b) If there is any matter in the domain under consideration, only its ][  ][ i
nertial mass, and thus according to Section 15 only its energy is ][  ][ of importance for its etfect in exciting a field. ][  ]
[ (c) Gravitational field and matter together must satisfy the law of ][  ][ the conservation of energy (and of impulse). ][  ][
 Finally, the general principle of relativity permits us to determine ][  ][ the influence of the gravitational field on the cou
rse of all those ][  ][ processes which take place according to known laws when a ][  ][ gravitational field is absent i.e. whic
h have already been fitted into ][  ][ the frame of the special theory of relativity. In this connection we ][  ][ proceed in pr
inciple according to the method which has already been ][  ][ explained for measuring-rods, clocks and freely moving material ][
  ][ points. ][  ][ The theory of gravitation derived in this way from the general ][  ][ postulate of relativity excels not onl
y in its beauty ; nor in ][  ][ removing the defect attaching to classical mechanics which was brought ][  ][ to light in Sectio
n 21; nor in interpreting the empirical law of ][  ][ the equality of inertial and gravitational mass ; but it has also ][  ][ a
lready explained a result of observation in astronomy, against which ][  ][ classical mechanics is powerless. ][  ][ If we confi
ne the application of the theory to the case where the ][  ][ gravitational fields can be regarded as being weak, and in which a
ll ][  ][ masses move with respect to the coordinate system with velocities ][  ][ which are small compared with the velocity of
 light, we then obtain as ][  ][ a first approximation the Newtonian theory. Thus the latter theory is ][  ][ obtained here with
out any particular assumption, whereas Newton had to ][  ][ introduce the hypothesis that the force of attraction between mutual
ly ][  ][ attracting material points is inversely proportional to the square of ][  ][ the distance between them. If we increase
 the accuracy of the ][  ][ calculation, deviations from the theory of Newton make their ][  ][ appearance, practically all of w
hich must nevertheless escape the test ][  ][ of observation owing to their smallness. ][  ][ We must draw attention here to one
 of these deviations. According to ][  ][ Newton's theory, a planet moves round the sun in an ellipse, which ][  ][ would perman
ently maintain its position with respect to the fixed ][  ][ stars, if we could disregard the motion of the fixed stars themselv
es ][  ][ and the action of the other planets under consideration. Thus, if we ][  ][ correct the observed motion of the planets
 for these two influences, ][  ][ and if Newton's theory be strictly correct, we ought to obtain for the ][  ][ orbit of the pla
net an ellipse, which is fixed with reference to the ][  ][ fixed stars. This deduction, which can be tested with great accuracy
, ][  ][ has been confirmed for all the planets save one, with the precision ][  ][ that is capable of being obtained by the del
icacy of observation ][  ][ attainable at the present time. The sole exception is Mercury, the ][  ][ planet which lies nearest 
the sun. Since the time of Leverrier, it has ][  ][ been known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit of Mercury, ][  ][ af
ter it has been corrected for the influences mentioned above, is not ][  ][ stationary with respect to the fixed stars, but that
 it rotates ][  ][ exceedingly slowly in the plane of the orbit and in the sense of the ][  ][ orbital motion. The value obtaine
d for this rotary movement of the ][  ][ orbital ellipse was 43 seconds of arc per century, an amount ensured ][  ][ to be corre
ct to within a few seconds of arc. This effect can be ][  ][ explained by means of classical mechanics only on the assumption of
 ][  ][ hypotheses which have little probability, and which were devised ][  ][ solely for this purponse. ][  ][ On the basis of
 the general theory of relativity, it is found that the ][  ][ ellipse of every planet round the sun must necessarily rotate in 
the ][  ][ manner indicated above ; that for all the planets, with the exception ][  ][ of Mercury, this rotation is too small t
o be detected with the ][  ][ delicacy of observation possible at the present time ; but that in the ][  ][ case of Mercury it m
ust amount to 43 seconds of arc per century, a ][  ][ result which is strictly in agreement with observation. ][  ][ Apart from 
this one, it has hitherto been possible to make only two ][  ][ deductions from the theory which admit of being tested by observ
ation, ][  ][ to wit, the curvature of light rays by the gravitational field of the ][  ][ sun,*x and a displacement of the spec
tral lines of light reaching ][  ][ us from large stars, as compared with the corresponding lines for ][  ][ light produced in a
n analogous manner terrestrially (i.e. by the same ][  ][ kind of atom).**  These two deductions from the theory have both ][  ]
[ been confirmed. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) First observed by Eddington and others in 1919. (Cf. Appendix ][  ][ III, pp. 126-129

 COSMOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES OF NEWTON'S THEORY ][  ][ Part from the difficulty discussed in Section 21, there is a second ][  ][ 
fundamental difficulty attending classical celestial mechanics, which, ][  ][ to the best of my knowledge, was first discussed i
n detail by the ][  ][ astronomer Seeliger. If we ponder over the question as to how the ][  ][ universe, considered as a whole,
 is to be regarded, the first answer ][  ][ that suggests itself to us is surely this: As regards space (and time) ][  ][ the un
iverse is infinite. There are stars everywhere, so that the ][  ][ density of matter, although very variable in detail, is never
theless ][  ][ on the average everywhere the same. In other words: However far we ][  ][ might travel through space, we should f
ind everywhere an attenuated ][  ][ swarm of fixed stars of approrimately the same kind and density. ][  ][ This view is not in 
harmony with the theory of Newton. The latter ][  ][ theory rather requires that the universe should have a kind of centre ][  ]
[ in which the density of the stars is a maximum, and that as we proceed ][  ][ outwards from this centre the group-density of t
he stars should ][  ][ diminish, until finally, at great distances, it is succeeded by an ][  ][ infinite region of emptiness. T
he stellar universe ought to be a ][  ][ finite island in the infinite ocean of space.* ][  ][ This conception is in itself not 
very satisfactory. It is still less ][  ][ satisfactory because it leads to the result that the light emitted by ][  ][ the star
s and also individual stars of the stellar system are ][  ][ perpetually passing out into infinite space, never to return, and ]
[  ][ without ever again coming into interaction with other objects of ][  ][ nature. Such a finite material universe would be d
estined to become ][  ][ gradually but systematically impoverished. ][  ][ In order to escape this dilemma, Seeliger suggested a
 modification of ][  ][ Newton's law, in which he assumes that for great distances the force ][  ][ of attraction between two ma
sses diminishes more rapidly than would ][  ][ result from the inverse square law. In this way it is possible for the ][  ][ mea
n density of matter to be constant everywhere, even to infinity, ][  ][ without infinitely large gravitational fields being prod
uced. We thus ][  ][ free ourselves from the distasteful conception that the material ][  ][ universe ought to possess something
 of the nature of a centre. Of ][  ][ course we purchase our emancipation from the fundamental difficulties ][  ][ mentioned, at
 the cost of a modification and complication of Newton's ][  ][ law which has neither empirical nor theoretical foundation. We c
an ][  ][ imagine innumerable laws which would serve the same purpose, without ][  ][ our being able to state a reason why one o
f them is to be preferred to ][  ][ the others ; for any one of these laws would be founded just as little ][  ][ on more genera
l theoretical principles as is the law of Newton. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) Proof -- According to the theory of Newton, the numbe
r of "lines ][  ][ of force" which come from infinity and terminate in a mass m is ][  ][ proportional to the mass m. If, on the
 average, the Mass density p[0] ][  ][ is constant throughout tithe universe, then a sphere of volume V will ][  ][ enclose the 
average man p[0]V. Thus the number of lines of force ][  ][ passing through the surface F of the sphere into its interior is ][ 
 ][ proportional to p[0] V. For unit area of the surface of the sphere the ][  ][ number of lines of force which enters the sphe
re is thus proportional ][  ][ to p[0] V/F or to p[0]R. Hence the intensity of the field at the ][  ][ surface would ultimately 
become infinite with increasing radius R of ][  ][ the sphere, which is impossible. ][  ][ THE POSSIBILITY OF A "FINITE" AND YET
 "UNBOUNDED" UNIVERSE ][  ][ But speculations on the structure of the universe also move in quite ][  ][ another direction. The 
development of non-Euclidean geometry led to ][  ][ the recognition of the fact, that we can cast doubt on the ][  ][ infinitene
ss of our space without coming into conflict with the laws ][  ][ of thought or with experience (Riemann, Helmholtz). These ques
tions ][  ][ have already been treated in detail and with unsurpassable lucidity by ][  ][ Helmholtz and Poincaré, whereas I ca
n only touch on them briefly here. ][  ][ In the first place, we imagine an existence in two dimensional space. ][  ][ Flat bein
gs with flat implements, and in particular flat rigid ][  ][ measuring-rods, are free to move in a plane. For them nothing exist
s ][  ][ outside of this plane: that which they observe to happen to themselves ][  ][ and to their flat " things " is the all-i
nclusive reality of their ][  ][ plane. In particular, the constructions of plane Euclidean geometry ][  ][ can be carried out b
y means of the rods e.g. the lattice construction, ][  ][ considered in Section 24. In contrast to ours, the universe of ][  ][ 
these beings is two-dimensional; but, like ours, it extends to ][  ][ infinity. In their universe there is room for an infinite 
number of ][  ][ identical squares made up of rods, i.e. its volume (surface) is ][  ][ infinite. If these beings say their univ
erse is " plane," there is ][  ][ sense in the statement, because they mean that they can perform the ][  ][ constructions of pl
ane Euclidean geometry with their rods. In this ][  ][ connection the individual rods always represent the same distance, ][  ][
 independently of their position. ][  ][ Let us consider now a second two-dimensional existence, but this time ][  ][ on a spher
ical surface instead of on a plane. The flat beings with ][  ][ their measuring-rods and other objects fit exactly on this surfa
ce and ][  ][ they are unable to leave it. Their whole universe of observation ][  ][ extends exclusively over the surface of th
e sphere. Are these beings ][  ][ able to regard the geometry of their universe as being plane geometry ][  ][ and their rods wi
thal as the realisation of " distance " ? They cannot ][  ][ do this. For if they attempt to realise a straight line, they will 
][  ][ obtain a curve, which we " three-dimensional beings " designate as a ][  ][ great circle, i.e. a self-contained line of d
efinite finite length, ][  ][ which can be measured up by means of a measuring-rod. Similarly, this ][  ][ universe has a finite
 area that can be compared with the area, of a ][  ][ square constructed with rods. The great charm resulting from this ][  ][ c
onsideration lies in the recognition of the fact that the universe of ][  ][ these beings is finite and yet has no limits. ][  ]
[ But the spherical-surface beings do not need to go on a world-tour in ][  ][ order to perceive that they are not living in a E
uclidean universe. ][  ][ They can convince themselves of this on every part of their " world," ][  ][ provided they do not use 
too small a piece of it. Starting from a ][  ][ point, they draw " straight lines " (arcs of circles as judged in ][  ][ three d
imensional space) of equal length in all directions. They will ][  ][ call the line joining the free ends of these lines a " cir
cle." For a ][  ][ plane surface, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its ][  ][ diameter, both lengths being measured
 with the same rod, is, according ][  ][ to Euclidean geometry of the plane, equal to a constant value p, which ][  ][ is indepe
ndent of the diameter of the circle. On their spherical ][  ][ surface our flat beings would find for this ratio the value ][  ]
[                         eq. 27: file eq27.gif ][  ][ i.e. a smaller value than p, the difference being the more ][  ][ conside
rable, the greater is the radius of the circle in comparison ][  ][ with the radius R of the " world-sphere." By means of this r
elation ][  ][ the spherical beings can determine the radius of their universe (" ][  ][ world "), even when only a relatively s
mall part of their worldsphere ][  ][ is available for their measurements. But if this part is very small ][  ][ indeed, they wi
ll no longer be able to demonstrate that they are on a ][  ][ spherical " world " and not on a Euclidean plane, for a small part
 of ][  ][ a spherical surface differs only slightly from a piece of a plane of ][  ][ the same size. ][  ][ Thus if the spheric
al surface beings are living on a planet of which ][  ][ the solar system occupies only a negligibly small part of the ][  ][ sp
herical universe, they have no means of determining whether they are ][  ][ living in a finite or in an infinite universe, becau
se the " piece of ][  ][ universe " to which they have access is in both cases practically ][  ][ plane, or Euclidean. It follow
s directly from this discussion, that ][  ][ for our sphere-beings the circumference of a circle first increases ][  ][ with the
 radius until the " circumference of the universe " is ][  ][ reached, and that it thenceforward gradually decreases to zero for
 ][  ][ still further increasing values of the radius. During this process the ][  ][ area of the circle continues to increase m
ore and more, until finally ][  ][ it becomes equal to the total area of the whole " world-sphere." ][  ][ Perhaps the reader wi
ll wonder why we have placed our " beings " on a ][  ][ sphere rather than on another closed surface. But this choice has its ][
  ][ justification in the fact that, of all closed surfaces, the sphere is ][  ][ unique in possessing the property that all poi
nts on it are ][  ][ equivalent. I admit that the ratio of the circumference c of a circle ][  ][ to its radius r depends on r, 
but for a given value of r it is the ][  ][ same for all points of the " worldsphere "; in other words, the " ][  ][ world-spher
e " is a " surface of constant curvature." ][  ][ To this two-dimensional sphere-universe there is a three-dimensional ][  ][ an
alogy, namely, the three-dimensional spherical space which was ][  ][ discovered by Riemann. its points are likewise all equival
ent. It ][  ][ possesses a finite volume, which is determined by its "radius" ][  ][ (2p2R3). Is it possible to imagine a spheri
cal space? To imagine a ][  ][ space means nothing else than that we imagine an epitome of our " ][  ][ space " experience, i.e.
 of experience that we can have in the ][  ][ movement of " rigid " bodies. In this sense we can imagine a spherical ][  ][ spac
e. ][  ][ Suppose we draw lines or stretch strings in all directions from a ][  ][ point, and mark off from each of these the di
stance r with a ][  ][ measuring-rod. All the free end-points of these lengths lie on a ][  ][ spherical surface. We can special
ly measure up the area (F) of this ][  ][ surface by means of a square made up of measuring-rods. If the ][  ][ universe is Eucl
idean, then F = 4pR2 ; if it is spherical, then F is ][  ][ always less than 4pR2. With increasing values of r, F increases from
 ][  ][ zero up to a maximum value which is determined by the " world-radius," ][  ][ but for still further increasing values of
 r, the area gradually ][  ][ diminishes to zero. At first, the straight lines which radiate from ][  ][ the starting point dive
rge farther and farther from one another, but ][  ][ later they approach each other, and finally they run together again at ][  
][ a "counter-point" to the starting point. Under such conditions they ][  ][ have traversed the whole spherical space. It is ea
sily seen that the ][  ][ three-dimensional spherical space is quite analogous to the ][  ][ two-dimensional spherical surface. 
It is finite (i.e. of finite ][  ][ volume), and has no bounds. ][  ][ It may be mentioned that there is yet another kind of cur
ved space: " ][  ][ elliptical space." It can be regarded as a curved space in which the ][  ][ two " counter-points " are ident
ical (indistinguishable from each ][  ][ other). An elliptical universe can thus be considered to some extent ][  ][ as a curved
 universe possessing central symmetry. ][  ][ It follows from what has been said, that closed spaces without limits ][  ][ are c
onceivable. From amongst these, the spherical space (and the ][  ][ elliptical) excels in its simplicity, since all points on it
 are ][  ][ equivalent. As a result of this discussion, a most interesting ][  ][ question arises for astronomers and physicists
, and that is whether ][  ][ the universe in which we live is infinite, or whether it is finite in ][  ][ the manner of the sphe
rical universe. Our experience is far from being ][  ][ sufficient to enable us to answer this question. But the general ][  ][ 
theory of relativity permits of our answering it with a moduate degree ][  ][ of certainty, and in this connection the difficult
y mentioned in ][  ][ Section 30 finds its solution. ][  ][ THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY
 ][  ][ According to the general theory of relativity, the geometrical ][  ][ properties of space are not independent, but they 
are determined by ][  ][ matter. Thus we can draw conclusions about the geometrical structure ][  ][ of the universe only if we 
base our considerations on the state of the ][  ][ matter as being something that is known. We know from experience that, ][  ][
 for a suitably chosen co-ordinate system, the velocities of the stars ][  ][ are small as compared with the velocity of transmi
ssion of light. We ][  ][ can thus as a rough approximation arrive at a conclusion as to the ][  ][ nature of the universe as a 
whole, if we treat the matter as being at ][  ][ rest. ][  ][ We already know from our previous discussion that the behaviour of
 ][  ][ measuring-rods and clocks is influenced by gravitational fields, i.e. ][  ][ by the distribution of matter. This in itse
lf is sufficient to exclude ][  ][ the possibility of the exact validity of Euclidean geometry in our ][  ][ universe. But it is
 conceivable that our universe differs only ][  ][ slightly from a Euclidean one, and this notion seems all the more ][  ][ prob
able, since calculations show that the metrics of surrounding ][  ][ space is influenced only to an exceedingly small extent by 
masses even ][  ][ of the magnitude of our sun. We might imagine that, as regards ][  ][ geometry, our universe behaves analogou
sly to a surface which is ][  ][ irregularly curved in its individual parts, but which nowhere departs ][  ][ appreciably from a
 plane: something like the rippled surface of a ][  ][ lake. Such a universe might fittingly be called a quasi-Euclidean ][  ][ 
universe. As regards its space it would be infinite. But calculation ][  ][ shows that in a quasi-Euclidean universe the average
 density of matter ][  ][ would necessarily be nil. Thus such a universe could not be inhabited ][  ][ by matter everywhere ; it
 would present to us that unsatisfactory ][  ][ picture which we portrayed in Section 30. ][  ][ If we are to have in the univer
se an average density of matter which ][  ][ differs from zero, however small may be that difference, then the ][  ][ universe c
annot be quasi-Euclidean. On the contrary, the results of ][  ][ calculation indicate that if matter be distributed uniformly, t
he ][  ][ universe would necessarily be spherical (or elliptical). Since in ][  ][ reality the detailed distribution of matter i
s not uniform, the real ][  ][ universe will deviate in individual parts from the spherical, i.e. the ][  ][ universe will be qu
asi-spherical. But it will be necessarily finite. ][  ][ In fact, the theory supplies us with a simple connection *  between ][ 
 ][ the space-expanse of the universe and the average density of matter in ][  ][ it. ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) For the radius R 
of the universe we obtain the equation ][  ][                         eq. 28: file eq28.gif ][  ][ The use of the C.G.S. system 
in this equation gives 2/k = 1^.08.10^27; ][  ][ p is the average density of the matter and k is a constant connected ][  ][ wit
h the Newtonian constant of gravitation. ][  ][ APPENDIX I ][  ][ SIMPLE DERIVATION OF THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION ][  ][ (SUPPLE
MENTARY TO SECTION 11) ][  ][ For the relative orientation of the co-ordinate systems indicated in ][  ][ Fig. 2, the x-axes of 
both systems pernumently coincide. In the ][  ][ present case we can divide the problem into parts by considering first ][  ][ o
nly events which are localised on the x-axis. Any such event is ][  ][ represented with respect to the co-ordinate system K by t
he abscissa x ][  ][ and the time t, and with respect to the system K1 by the abscissa x' ][  ][ and the time t'. We require to 
find x' and t' when x and t are given. ][  ][ A light-signal, which is proceeding along the positive axis of x, is ][  ][ transm
itted according to the equation ][  ][                                 x = ct ][  ][ or ][  ][                  x - ct = 0     .
     .     .    (1). ][  ][ Since the same light-signal has to be transmitted relative to K1 with ][  ][ the velocity c, the pro
pagation relative to the system K1 will be ][  ][ represented by the analogous formula ][  ][                 x' - ct' = O     .
     .     .    (2) ][  ][ Those space-time points (events) which satisfy (x) must also satisfy ][  ][ (2). Obviously this will 
be the case when the relation ][  ][           (x' - ct') = l (x - ct)     .     .     .    (3). ][  ][ is fulfilled in general,
 where l indicates a constant ; for, according ][  ][ to (3), the disappearance of (x - ct) involves the disappearance of ][  ][
 (x' - ct'). ][  ][ If we apply quite similar considerations to light rays which are being ][  ][ transmitted along the negative
 x-axis, we obtain the condition ][  ][            (x' + ct') = µ(x + ct)    .     .     .    (4). ][  ][ By adding (or subtrac
ting) equations (3) and (4), and introducing for ][  ][ convenience the constants a and b in place of the constants l and µ, ][
  ][ where ][  ][                         eq. 29: file eq29.gif ][  ][ and ][  ][                         eq. 30: file eq30.gif 
][  ][ we obtain the equations ][  ][                         eq. 31: file eq31.gif ][  ][ We should thus have the solution of o
ur problem, if the constants a ][  ][ and b were known. These result from the following discussion. ][  ][ For the origin of K1 
we have permanently x' = 0, and hence according ][  ][ to the first of the equations (5) ][  ][                         eq. 32: 
file eq32.gif ][  ][ If we call v the velocity with which the origin of K1 is moving ][  ][ relative to K, we then have ][  ][  
                       eq. 33: file eq33.gif ][  ][ The same value v can be obtained from equations (5), if we calculate ][  ][ 
the velocity of another point of K1 relative to K, or the velocity ][  ][ (directed towards the negative x-axis) of a point of K
 with respect to ][  ][ K'. In short, we can designate v as the relative velocity of the two ][  ][ systems. ][  ][ Furthermore,
 the principle of relativity teaches us that, as judged ][  ][ from K, the length of a unit measuring-rod which is at rest with 
][  ][ reference to K1 must be exactly the same as the length, as judged from ][  ][ K', of a unit measuring-rod which is at res
t relative to K. In order ][  ][ to see how the points of the x-axis appear as viewed from K, we only ][  ][ require to take a "
 snapshot " of K1 from K; this means that we have ][  ][ to insert a particular value of t (time of K), e.g. t = 0. For this ][ 
 ][ value of t we then obtain from the first of the equations (5) ][  ][                                x' = ax ][  ][ Two point
s of the x'-axis which are separated by the distance Dx' = I ][  ][ when measured in the K1 system are thus separated in our ins
tantaneous ][  ][ photograph by the distance ][  ][                         eq. 34: file eq34.gif ][  ][ But if the snapshot be 
taken from K'(t' = 0), and if we eliminate t ][  ][ from the equations (5), taking into account the expression (6), we ][  ][ ob
tain ][  ][                         eq. 35: file eq35.gif ][  ][ From this we conclude that two points on the x-axis separated b
y the ][  ][ distance I (relative to K) will be represented on our snapshot by the ][  ][ distance ][  ][                       
  eq. 36: file eq36.gif ][  ][ But from what has been said, the two snapshots must be identical; ][  ][ hence Dx in (7) must be 
equal to Dx' in (7a), so that we obtain ][  ][                         eq. 37: file eq37.gif ][  ][ The equations (6) and (7b) d
etermine the constants a and b. By ][  ][ inserting the values of these constants in (5), we obtain the first ][  ][ and the fou
rth of the equations given in Section 11. ][  ][                         eq. 38: file eq38.gif ][  ][ Thus we have obtained the 
Lorentz transformation for events on the ][  ][ x-axis. It satisfies the condition ][  ][          x'2 - c^2t'2 = x2 - c^2t2    
.     .     .    (8a). ][  ][ The extension of this result, to include events which take place ][  ][ outside the x-axis, is obt
ained by retaining equations (8) and ][  ][ supplementing them by the relations ][  ][                         eq. 39: file eq39
.gif ][  ][ In this way we satisfy the postulate of the constancy of the velocity ][  ][ of light in vacuo for rays of light of 
arbitrary direction, both for ][  ][ the system K and for the system K'. This may be shown in the following ][  ][ manner. ][  ]
[ We suppose a light-signal sent out from the origin of K at the time t ][  ][ = 0. It will be propagated according to the equat
ion ][  ][                         eq. 40: file eq40.gif ][  ][ or, if we square this equation, according to the equation ][  ][
           x2 + y2 + z2 = c^2t2 = 0    .     .     .    (10). ][  ][ It is required by the law of propagation of light, in conju
nction with ][  ][ the postulate of relativity, that the transmission of the signal in ][  ][ question should take place -- as j
udged from K1 -- in accordance with ][  ][ the corresponding formula ][  ][                                r' = ct' ][  ][ or, ]
[  ][        x'2 + y'2 + z'2 - c^2t'2 = 0    .     .     .    (10a). ][  ][ In order that equation (10a) may be a consequence of
 equation (10), we ][  ][ must have ][  ][    x'2 + y'2 + z'2 - c^2t'2 = s (x2 + y2 + z2 - c^2t2)       (11). ][  ][ Since equat
ion (8a) must hold for points on the x-axis, we thus have s ][  ][ = I. It is easily seen that the Lorentz transformation really
 ][  ][ satisfies equation (11) for s = I; for (11) is a consequence of (8a) ][  ][ and (9), and hence also of (8) and (9). We h
ave thus derived the ][  ][ Lorentz transformation. ][  ][ The Lorentz transformation represented by (8) and (9) still requires 
][  ][ to be generalised. Obviously it is immaterial whether the axes of K1 ][  ][ be chosen so that they are spatially parallel
 to those of K. It is ][  ][ also not essential that the velocity of translation of K1 with respect ][  ][ to K should be in the
 direction of the x-axis. A simple consideration ][  ][ shows that we are able to construct the Lorentz transformation in this ]
[  ][ general sense from two kinds of transformations, viz. from Lorentz ][  ][ transformations in the special sense and from pu
rely spatial ][  ][ transformations. which corresponds to the replacement of the ][  ][ rectangular co-ordinate system by a new 
system with its axes pointing ][  ][ in other directions. ][  ][ Mathematically, we can characterise the generalised Lorentz ][ 
 ][ transformation thus : ][  ][ It expresses x', y', x', t', in terms of linear homogeneous functions ][  ][ of x, y, x, t, of 
such a kind that the relation ][  ][      x'2 + y'2 + z'2 - c^2t'2 = x2 + y2 + z2 - c^2t2       (11a). ][  ][ is satisficd ident
ically. That is to say: If we substitute their ][  ][ expressions in x, y, x, t, in place of x', y', x', t', on the ][  ][ left-
hand side, then the left-hand side of (11a) agrees with the ][  ][ right-hand side. ][  ][ APPENDIX II ][  ][ MINKOWSKI'S FOUR-D
IMENSIONAL SPACE ("WORLD") ][  ][ (SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION 17) ][  ][ We can characterise the Lorentz transformation still more
 simply if we ][  ][ introduce the imaginary eq. 25 in place of t, as time-variable. If, in ][  ][ accordance with this, we inse
rt ][  ][                               x[1] = x ][  ][                               x[2] = y ][  ][                           
    x[3] = z ][  ][                               x[4] = eq. 25 ][  ][ and similarly for the accented system K1, then the condit
ion which is ][  ][ identically satisfied by the transformation can be expressed thus : ][  ][ x[1]'2 + x[2]'2 + x[3]'2 + x[4]'2
 = x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 + x[3]^2 + x[4]^2 ][  ][     (12). ][  ][ That is, by the afore-mentioned choice of " coordinates," (11a) [se
e ][  ][ the end of Appendix II] is transformed into this equation. ][  ][ We see from (12) that the imaginary time co-ordinate 
x[4], enters into ][  ][ the condition of transformation in exactly the same way as the space ][  ][ co-ordinates x[1], x[2], x[
3]. It is due to this fact that, according ][  ][ to the theory of relativity, the " time "x[4], enters into natural ][  ][ laws
 in the same form as the space co ordinates x[1], x[2], x[3]. ][  ][ A four-dimensional continuum described by the "co-ordinates

rld." ][  ][ This four-dimensional " world " bears a close similarity to the ][  ][ three-dimensional " space " of (Euclidean) a
nalytical geometry. If we ][  ][ introduce into the latter a new Cartesian co-ordinate system (x'[1], ][  ][ x'[2], x'[3]) with 
the same origin, then x'[1], x'[2], x'[3], are ][  ][ linear homogeneous functions of x[1], x[2], x[3] which identically ][  ][ 
satisfy the equation ][  ][         x'[1]^2 + x'[2]^2 + x'[3]^2 = x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 + x[3]^2 ][  ][ The analogy with (12) is a com
plete one. We can regard Minkowski's " ][  ][ world " in a formal manner as a four-dimensional Euclidean space (with ][  ][ an i
maginary time coordinate) ; the Lorentz transformation corresponds ][  ][ to a " rotation " of the co-ordinate system in the fou
rdimensional " ][  ][ world." ][  ][ APPENDIX III ][  ][ THE EXPERIMENTAL CONFIRMATION OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ][  ]
[ From a systematic theoretical point of view, we may imagine the ][  ][ process of evolution of an empirical science to be a co
ntinuous ][  ][ process of induction. Theories are evolved and are expressed in short ][  ][ compass as statements of a large nu
mber of individual observations in ][  ][ the form of empirical laws, from which the general laws can be ][  ][ ascertained by c
omparison. Regarded in this way, the development of a ][  ][ science bears some resemblance to the compilation of a classified ]
[  ][ catalogue. It is, as it were, a purely empirical enterprise. ][  ][ But this point of view by no means embraces the whole 
of the actual ][  ][ process ; for it slurs over the important part played by intuition and ][  ][ deductive thought in the deve
lopment of an exact science. As soon as a ][  ][ science has emerged from its initial stages, theoretical advances are ][  ][ no
 longer achieved merely by a process of arrangement. Guided by ][  ][ empirical data, the investigator rather develops a system 
of thought ][  ][ which, in general, is built up logically from a small number of ][  ][ fundamental assumptions, the so-called 
axioms. We call such a system ][  ][ of thought a theory. The theory finds the justification for its ][  ][ existence in the fac
t that it correlates a large number of single ][  ][ observations, and it is just here that the " truth " of the theory ][  ][ l
ies. ][  ][ Corresponding to the same complex of empirical data, there may be ][  ][ several theories, which differ from one ano
ther to a considerable ][  ][ extent. But as regards the deductions from the theories which are ][  ][ capable of being tested, 
the agreement between the theories may be so ][  ][ complete that it becomes difficult to find any deductions in which the ][  ]
[ two theories differ from each other. As an example, a case of general ][  ][ interest is available in the province of biology,
 in the Darwinian ][  ][ theory of the development of species by selection in the struggle for ][  ][ existence, and in the theo
ry of development which is based on the ][  ][ hypothesis of the hereditary transmission of acquired characters. ][  ][ We have 
another instance of far-reaching agreement between the ][  ][ deductions from two theories in Newtonian mechanics on the one han
d, ][  ][ and the general theory of relativity on the other. This agreement goes ][  ][ so far, that up to the preseat we have b
een able to find only a few ][  ][ deductions from the general theory of relativity which are capable of ][  ][ investigation, a
nd to which the physics of pre-relativity days does ][  ][ not also lead, and this despite the profound difference in the ][  ][
 fundamental assumptions of the two theories. In what follows, we shall ][  ][ again consider these important deductions, and we
 shall also discuss ][  ][ the empirical evidence appertaining to them which has hitherto been ][  ][ obtained. ][  ][  (a) Moti
on of the Perihelion of Mercury ][  ][ According to Newtonian mechanics and Newton's law of gravitation, a ][  ][ planet which i
s revolving round the sun would describe an ellipse ][  ][ round the latter, or, more correctly, round the common centre of ][  
][ gravity of the sun and the planet. In such a system, the sun, or the ][  ][ common centre of gravity, lies in one of the foci
 of the orbital ][  ][ ellipse in such a manner that, in the course of a planet-year, the ][  ][ distance sun-planet grows from 
a minimum to a maximum, and then ][  ][ decreases again to a minimum. If instead of Newton's law we insert a ][  ][ somewhat dif
ferent law of attraction into the calculation, we find ][  ][ that, according to this new law, the motion would still take place
 in ][  ][ such a manner that the distance sun-planet exhibits periodic ][  ][ variations; but in this case the angle described 
by the line joining ][  ][ sun and planet during such a period (from perihelion--closest ][  ][ proximity to the sun--to perihel
ion) would differ from 360^0. The line ][  ][ of the orbit would not then be a closed one but in the course of time ][  ][ it wo
uld fill up an annular part of the orbital plane, viz. between ][  ][ the circle of least and the circle of greatest distance of
 the planet ][  ][ from the sun. ][  ][ According also to the general theory of relativity, which differs of ][  ][ course from 
the theory of Newton, a small variation from the ][  ][ Newton-Kepler motion of a planet in its orbit should take place, and ][ 
 ][ in such away, that the angle described by the radius sun-planet ][  ][ between one perhelion and the next should exceed that
 corresponding to ][  ][ one complete revolution by an amount given by ][  ][                         eq. 41: file eq41.gif ][  
][ (N.B. -- One complete revolution corresponds to the angle 2p in the ][  ][ absolute angular measure customary in physics, and
 the above ][  ][ expression giver the amount by which the radius sun-planet exceeds ][  ][ this angle during the interval betwe
en one perihelion and the next.) ][  ][ In this expression a represents the major semi-axis of the ellipse, e ][  ][ its eccentr
icity, c the velocity of light, and T the period of ][  ][ revolution of the planet. Our result may also be stated as follows : 
][  ][ According to the general theory of relativity, the major axis of the ][  ][ ellipse rotates round the sun in the same sen
se as the orbital motion ][  ][ of the planet. Theory requires that this rotation should amount to 43 ][  ][ seconds of arc per 
century for the planet Mercury, but for the other ][  ][ Planets of our solar system its magnitude should be so small that it ][
  ][ would necessarily escape detection. * ][  ][ In point of fact, astronomers have found that the theory of Newton ][  ][ does
 not suffice to calculate the observed motion of Mercury with an ][  ][ exactness corresponding to that of the delicacy of obser
vation ][  ][ attainable at the present time. After taking account of all the ][  ][ disturbing influences exerted on Mercury by
 the remaining planets, it ][  ][ was found (Leverrier: 1859; and Newcomb: 1895) that an unexplained ][  ][ perihelial movement 
of the orbit of Mercury remained over, the amount ][  ][ of which does not differ sensibly from the above mentioned +43 seconds 
][  ][ of arc per century. The uncertainty of the empirical result amounts to ][  ][ a few seconds only. ][  ][  (b) Deflection 
of Light by a Gravitational Field ][  ][ In Section 22 it has been already mentioned that according to the ][  ][ general theory
 of relativity, a ray of light will experience a ][  ][ curvature of its path when passing through a gravitational field, this ]
[  ][ curvature being similar to that experienced by the path of a body ][  ][ which is projected through a gravitational field.
 As a result of this ][  ][ theory, we should expect that a ray of light which is passing close to ][  ][ a heavenly body would 
be deviated towards the latter. For a ray of ][  ][ light which passes the sun at a distance of D sun-radii from its ][  ][ cent
re, the angle of deflection (a) should amount to ][  ][                         eq. 42: file eq42.gif ][  ][ It may be added tha
t, according to the theory, half of Figure 05 this ][  ][ deflection is produced by the Newtonian field of attraction of the ][ 
 ][ sun, and the other half by the geometrical modification (" curvature ][  ][ ") of space caused by the sun. ][  ][ This resul
t admits of an experimental test by means of the ][  ][ photographic registration of stars during a total eclipse of the sun. ][
  ][ The only reason why we must wait for a total eclipse is because at ][  ][ every other time the atmosphere is so strongly il
luminated by the ][  ][ light from the sun that the stars situated near the sun's disc are ][  ][ invisible. The predicted effec
t can be seen clearly from the ][  ][ accompanying diagram. If the sun (S) were not present, a star which is ][  ][ practically 
infinitely distant would be seen in the direction D[1], as ][  ][ observed front the earth. But as a consequence of the deflecti
on of ][  ][ light from the star by the sun, the star will be seen in the direction ][  ][ D[2], i.e. at a somewhat greater dist
ance from the centre of the sun ][  ][ than corresponds to its real position. ][  ][ In practice, the question is tested in the 
following way. The stars in ][  ][ the neighbourhood of the sun are photographed during a solar eclipse. ][  ][ In addition, a s
econd photograph of the same stars is taken when the ][  ][ sun is situated at another position in the sky, i.e. a few months ][
  ][ earlier or later. As compared whh the standard photograph, the ][  ][ positions of the stars on the eclipse-photograph ough
t to appear ][  ][ displaced radially outwards (away from the centre of the sun) by an ][  ][ amount corresponding to the angle 
a. ][  ][ We are indebted to the [British] Royal Society and to the Royal ][  ][ Astronomical Society for the investigation of t
his important ][  ][ deduction. Undaunted by the [first world] war and by difficulties of ][  ][ both a material and a psycholog
ical nature aroused by the war, these ][  ][ societies equipped two expeditions -- to Sobral (Brazil), and to the ][  ][ island 
of Principe (West Africa) -- and sent several of Britain's most ][  ][ celebrated astronomers (Eddington, Cottingham, Crommelin,
 Davidson), ][  ][ in order to obtain photographs of the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. ][  ][ The relative discrepancies to b
e expected between the stellar ][  ][ photographs obtained during the eclipse and the comparison photographs ][  ][ amounted to 
a few hundredths of a millimetre only. Thus great accuracy ][  ][ was necessary in making the adjustments required for the takin
g of the ][  ][ photographs, and in their subsequent measurement. ][  ][ The results of the measurements confirmed the theory in
 a thoroughly ][  ][ satisfactory manner. The rectangular components of the observed and of ][  ][ the calculated deviations of 
the stars (in seconds of arc) are set ][  ][ forth in the following table of results : ][  ][                       Table 01: fi
le table01.gif ][  ][  (c) Displacement of Spectral Lines Towards the Red ][  ][ In Section 23 it has been shown that in a syste
m K1 which is in ][  ][ rotation with regard to a Galileian system K, clocks of identical ][  ][ construction, and which are con
sidered at rest with respect to the ][  ][ rotating reference-body, go at rates which are dependent on the ][  ][ positions of t
he clocks. We shall now examine this dependence ][  ][ quantitatively. A clock, which is situated at a distance r from the ][  ]
[ centre of the disc, has a velocity relative to K which is given by ][  ][                                 V = wr ][  ][ where 
w represents the angular velocity of rotation of the disc K1 ][  ][ with respect to K. If v[0], represents the number of ticks o
f the ][  ][ clock per unit time (" rate " of the clock) relative to K when the ][  ][ clock is at rest, then the " rate " of th
e clock (v) when it is moving ][  ][ relative to K with a velocity V, but at rest with respect to the disc, ][  ][ will, in acco
rdance with Section 12, be given by ][  ][                         eq. 43: file eq43.gif ][  ][ or with sufficient accuracy by ]
[  ][                         eq. 44: file eq44.gif ][  ][ This expression may also be stated in the following form: ][  ][     
                    eq. 45: file eq45.gif ][  ][ If we represent the difference of potential of the centrifugal force ][  ][ bet
ween the position of the clock and the centre of the disc by f, ][  ][ i.e. the work, considered negatively, which must be perfo
rmed on the ][  ][ unit of mass against the centrifugal force in order to transport it ][  ][ from the position of the clock on 
the rotating disc to the centre of ][  ][ the disc, then we have ][  ][                         eq. 46: file eq46.gif ][  ][ Fro
m this it follows that ][  ][                         eq. 47: file eq47.gif ][  ][ In the first place, we see from this expressi
on that two clocks of ][  ][ identical construction will go at different rates when situated at ][  ][ different distances from 
the centre of the disc. This result is aiso ][  ][ valid from the standpoint of an observer who is rotating with the ][  ][ disc
. ][  ][ Now, as judged from the disc, the latter is in a gravititional field ][  ][ of potential f, hence the result we have ob
tained will hold quite ][  ][ generally for gravitational fields. Furthermore, we can regard an atom ][  ][ which is emitting sp
ectral lines as a clock, so that the following ][  ][ statement will hold: ][  ][ An atom absorbs or emits light of a frequency 
which is dependent on ][  ][ the potential of the gravitational field in which it is situated. ][  ][ The frequency of an atom s
ituated on the surface of a heavenly body ][  ][ will be somewhat less than the frequency of an atom of the same ][  ][ element 
which is situated in free space (or on the surface of a ][  ][ smaller celestial body). ][  ][ Now f = - K (M/r), where K is New
ton's constant of gravitation, and M ][  ][ is the mass of the heavenly body. Thus a displacement towards the red ][  ][ ought t
o take place for spectral lines produced at the surface of ][  ][ stars as compared with the spectral lines of the same element 
produced ][  ][ at the surface of the earth, the amount of this displacement being ][  ][                         eq. 48: file e
q48.gif ][  ][ For the sun, the displacement towards the red predicted by theory ][  ][ amounts to about two millionths of the w
ave-length. A trustworthy ][  ][ calculation is not possible in the case of the stars, because in ][  ][ general neither the mas
s M nor the radius r are known. ][  ][ It is an open question whether or not this effect exists, and at the ][  ][ present time 
(1920) astronomers are working with great zeal towards ][  ][ the solution. Owing to the smallness of the effect in the case of 
the ][  ][ sun, it is difficult to form an opinion as to its existence. Whereas ][  ][ Grebe and Bachem (Bonn), as a result of t
heir own measurements and ][  ][ those of Evershed and Schwarzschild on the cyanogen bands, have placed ][  ][ the existence of 
the effect almost beyond doubt, while other ][  ][ investigators, particularly St. John, have been led to the opposite ][  ][ op
inion in consequence of their measurements. ][  ][ Mean displacements of lines towards the less refrangible end of the ][  ][ sp
ectrum are certainly revealed by statistical investigations of the ][  ][ fixed stars ; but up to the present the examination of
 the available ][  ][ data does not allow of any definite decision being arrived at, as to ][  ][ whether or not these displacem
ents are to be referred in reality to ][  ][ the effect of gravitation. The results of observation have been ][  ][ collected to
gether, and discussed in detail from the standpoint of the ][  ][ question which has been engaging our attention here, in a pape
r by E. ][  ][ Freundlich entitled "Zur Prüfung der allgemeinen ][  ][ Relativit&umlaut;ts-Theorie" (Die Naturwissenschaften, 1
919, No. 35, ][  ][ p. 520: Julius Springer, Berlin). ][  ][ At all events, a definite decision will be reached during the next 
few ][  ][ years. If the displacement of spectral lines towards the red by the ][  ][ gravitational potential does not exist, th
en the general theory of ][  ][ relativity will be untenable. On the other hand, if the cause of the ][  ][ displacement of spec
tral lines be definitely traced to the ][  ][ gravitational potential, then the study of this displacement will ][  ][ furnish u
s with important information as to the mass of the heavenly ][  ][ bodies. [5][A] ][  ][   Notes ][  ][ *) Especially since the 
next planet Venus has an orbit that is ][  ][ almost an exact circle, which makes it more difficult to locate the ][  ][ perihel
ion with precision. ][  ][ The displacentent of spectral lines towards the red end of the ][  ][ spectrum was definitely establi
shed by Adams in 1924, by observations ][  ][ on the dense companion of Sirius, for which the effect is about thirty ][  ][ time
s greater than for the Sun. R.W.L. -- translator ][  ][ APPENDIX IV ][  ][ THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL THEOR
Y OF RELATIVITY ][  ][ (SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION 32) ][  ][ Since the publication of the first edition of this little book, our 
][  ][ knowledge about the structure of space in the large (" cosmological ][  ][ problem ") has had an important development, w
hich ought to be ][  ][ mentioned even in a popular presentation of the subject. ][  ][ My original considerations on the subjec
t were based on two ][  ][ hypotheses: ][  ][ (1) There exists an average density of matter in the whole of space ][  ][ which i
s everywhere the same and different from zero. ][  ][ (2) The magnitude (" radius ") of space is independent of time. ][  ][ Bot
h these hypotheses proved to be consistent, according to the ][  ][ general theory of relativity, but only after a hypothetical 
term was ][  ][ added to the field equations, a term which was not required by the ][  ][ theory as such nor did it seem natural
 from a theoretical point of ][  ][ view (" cosmological term of the field equations "). ][  ][ Hypothesis (2) appeared unavoida
ble to me at the time, since I thought ][  ][ that one would get into bottomless speculations if one departed from ][  ][ it. ][
  ][ However, already in the 'twenties, the Russian mathematician Friedman ][  ][ showed that a different hypothesis was natural
 from a purely ][  ][ theoretical point of view. He realized that it was possible to ][  ][ preserve hypothesis (1) without intr
oducing the less natural ][  ][ cosmological term into the field equations of gravitation, if one was ][  ][ ready to drop hypot
hesis (2). Namely, the original field equations ][  ][ admit a solution in which the " world radius " depends on time ][  ][ (ex
panding space). In that sense one can say, according to Friedman, ][  ][ that the theory demands an expansion of space. ][  ][ A
 few years later Hubble showed, by a special investigation of the ][  ][ extra-galactic nebulae (" milky ways "), that the spect
ral lines ][  ][ emitted showed a red shift which increased regularly with the distance ][  ][ of the nebulae. This can be inter
preted in regard to our present ][  ][ knowledge only in the sense of Doppler's principle, as an expansive ][  ][ motion of the 
system of stars in the large -- as required, according ][  ][ to Friedman, by the field equations of gravitation. Hubble's disco
very ][  ][ can, therefore, be considered to some extent as a confirmation of the ][  ][ theory. ][  ][ There does arise, howeve
r, a strange difficulty. The interpretation of ][  ][ the galactic line-shift discovered by Hubble as an expansion (which ][  ][
 can hardly be doubted from a theoretical point of view), leads to an ][  ][ origin of this expansion which lies " only " about 
10^9 years ago, ][  ][ while physical astronomy makes it appear likely that the development ][  ][ of individual stars and syste
ms of stars takes considerably longer. It ][  ][ is in no way known how this incongruity is to be overcome. ][  ][ I further wan
t to rernark that the theory of expanding space, together ][  ][ with the empirical data of astronomy, permit no decision to be 
reached ][  ][ about the finite or infinite character of (three-dimensional) space, ][  ][ while the original " static " hypothe
sis of space yielded the closure ][  ][ (finiteness) of space. ][  ][ K = co-ordinate system ][  ][ x, y = two-dimensional co-or
